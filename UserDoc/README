This directory contains the sources and tools needed to build the
Specware documentation.  The build process currently (Oct. 5, 2012)
works on Linux and Mac OSX. 

Required programs include:

+python

Additionally, the python 'sphinx' and 'docutils' packages are
required. Assuming that you have a working python installation, it should be possible to install these two packages with the command:

sudo easy_install sphinx


There are five main documents that get built, each with its own directory:
 language-manual
 user-manual
 tutorial
 xform-manual
 isabelle-interface


To build the documentation, type 'make'. This will build a pdf version
of each manual. To build an HTML version, execute 'make html'. See the
manual writers guide for more information on the various makefile
targets.

This file was written by Eric Smith, based on information from Lambert
Meertens, and modified by Garrin Kimmell to reflect updates of the
manual format to restructuredtext. For more information, see
README-MANUAL-WRITERS.
