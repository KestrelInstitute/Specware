This directory contains the sources and tools needed to build the
Specware documentation.  The build process currently (Oct. 5, 2012)
works on Linux.  It may be close to working on Mac.

Required programs include:

+gcc

+various Linux command line utilities (e.g., sed)

+pdfjadetex - Jade converts docbook to html or tex.  Openjade seems to
  work.  Note that on some systems pdfjadetex is just a link to
  pdfetex, but it seems that you still need pdfjadetex.

+what else?

There are five main documents that get built, each with its own directory:
 language-manual
 user-manual
 tutorial
 xform-manual
 isabelle-interface

Tools used to build these documents are in src/, with compiled code
put into bin/.  More details:

src/glm2dbk.c - converts glm to docbook (C version of a tool Lambert
originally wrote in his ABC language, a predecessor of Python)

src/dbk2glm.c - converts in the other direction, useful for sanity
checking (C version of a tool Lambert originally wrote in ABC)

The individual documents also have their own bin/ directories, of which
language-manual/bin/ is the most interesting.  It contains a couple of
tools for generating parts of the document: the list of reserved words,
and the appendix containing all the grammar rules (which are extracted
from the rest of the document sources).  More details:

language-manual/src/reswords.c - Tool that takes a list of reserved
words and builds a glm file with columns. Get compiled to
language-manual/bin/reswords.o and is called by
language-manual/bin/mkreswords.

language-manual/src/glmgrammar.c - Tool that extracts all grammar
rules from language manual. Gets compiled to
language-manual/bin/glmgrammar.o and is called by language-manual/bin/mkgrammar.

To build the documentation, type 'make'.

For a slightly fuller test, type './test'.
