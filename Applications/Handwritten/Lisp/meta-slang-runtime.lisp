  slang-term-equals
  -----------------
     This function determines equality for lisp expressions that
     are generated from EXT-SLANG terms admitting equality.


     A translated ext-slang term admitting equality can be in one of the
     following forms:

  (vector t1 t2 ... tn)   - a product
  (cons t1 t2)            - a two tuple
  (cons t1 t2) , nil      - an element of a list sort
  (list 'Quotient 'fn t)  - an element of a quotient sort
  (cons 'Name t)          - an embedding
  atom                    - a string, char, or nat constant.
