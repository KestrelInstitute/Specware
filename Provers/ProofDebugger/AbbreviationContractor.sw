  import ExtendedTypesAndExpressions

  (* This spec defines ops to "reverse" the abbreviation expansions defined in
  the proof checker. The ops defined in this spec map types and expressions of
  (meta) types Type and Expression to extended types and expressions of (meta)
  types ExtType and ExtExpression, attempting to replace the types and
  expressions that result from epanding abbreviations with the abbreviations
  themselves, which are first-class extended types and expressions.

  Suppose that we start with an extended type or expression that only contains
  user fields and variables (i.e. no prod fields or abbr variables). Suppose
  that we expand all its abbreviations, obtaining a non-extended type or
  expression (this process is not explicitly defined in this or other specs,
  but could be defined). Then, the ops defined in this spec can almost exactly
  reconstruct the starting extended type or expression. The reason is that the
  (only) type abbreviation expansion contains prod fields and that most
  expression abbreviation expansions contain abbr variables, whose presence
  indicates that a type or expression containing abbr variables is the result
  of expanding an abbreviation and has not been directly provided by the
  user. The cases in which the reconstruction may not be perfect are pointed
  out later in this spec; as we will see, those cases are rather unimportant
  from a practical point of view.

  As mentioned in spec ExtendedTypesAndExpressions, the reason to not use
  extended types and expressions directly in the proof checker is to keep the
  proof checker smaller and simpler. The abbreviation contraction ops defined
  in this spec serve to print out types and expressions in a more readable
  manner for the user. However, the correctness of the proof checker itself
  does not depend on the ops defined in this spec. *)

  (* First of all, we define (mutually recursive) ops to embed non-extended
  types and expressions into extended types and expressions. This is the first
  step in our abbreviation contraction process; the rest operates entirely
  within extended types and expressions. *)

  (* Since there are many expression abbreviations, we define generic ops to
  contract expression abbreviations in types, expressions, and also binding
  branches.

  These ops are parameterized over a function over expressions, meant to
  capture the contraction of an abbreviation. The type Contraction defined
  below contains all possible functions between expressions, not just
  contractions. However, only contractions will be used in this spec.

  The three ops defined below process a type, expression, or binding branch by
  first recursively processing its constituent types, expressions, and binding
  branches and then, in the case of an expression, by applying the contraction
  to the expression. The contractions defined in this spec are such that they
  leave the expression unchanged if it is not recognized as the expansion of
  some abbreviation. *)

  (* We define one contraction for each expression abbreviation. The
  definitions are derived by "reversing" the abbreviation definitions in the
  proof checker. The contractions are mostly straightforward, but some
  specific comments are given for some of them.

  Each contraction assumes that the previous contractions have already been
  applied. So, for instance, the contraction of FALSE can assume that TRUE has
  already been contracted.

  As mentioned earlier, our contraction process can almost always reconstruct
  an (extended) expression that does not contain abbr variables, after all
  abbreviations have been expanded. The exceptions are due to the
  abbreviations that do not involve abbr variables. One such example is the
  expansion of NEG(e) into APPLY(NOT,e). Our contraction process always
  contracts APPLY(NOT,e) into NEG(e), even if the starting point, before
  expanding abbreviations, was APPLY(NOT,e). Another example if the expansion
  of AND(e1,e2) into IF(e1,e2,FALSE).

  This is not a big problem in practice, because the purpose of the
  contraction process is just to support more readable printing of types and
  expressions. From this perspective, NEG(e) and APPLY(NOT,e) are equivalent,
  and would probably be printed as the exact same strings anyhow. The case of
  AND(e1,e2) vs. IF(e1,e2,FALSE) is a little more significant, but it should
  be relatively rare for users to explicitly write IF(e1,e2,FALSE). *)
