  (* To improve the readability of the checking function defined in spec
  Checker, we introduce a monad whose states are the ones defined in spec
  States and whose exceptions are the failures defined in spec Failures. It is
  not appropriate to explain monads here; so, the unfamiliar reader is
  referred to the literature, for instance Philip Wadler's "Monads for
  functional programming".

  We use the name "M", despite its shortness, because it is inconspicuous.
  After all, the purpose of monads is exactly to "hide" certain details. *)
