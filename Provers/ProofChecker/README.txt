This directory contains a proof checker for the Metaslang logic, written in
Metaslang. The Metaslang logic is formally defined in the document "The Logic
of Metaslang", by Alessandro Coglio, available at Specware4/DevDoc/logic.pdf.
Read that document first and refer to it while reading the .sw files in this
directory. The document is referred to as "LD" (for "Logic Document") in the
comments in the files.

The subdirectory Libs contains units that are candidate for inclusion in the
standard Specware library, because they are not specific to the proof
checker.
