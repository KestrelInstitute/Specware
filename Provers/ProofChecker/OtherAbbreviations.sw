  import BasicAbbreviations, Substitutions

  (* This spec defines meta ops that capture the abbreviations introduced in
  Section 6 of LD. The abbreviations introduced in Section 2 of LD are covered
  in spec BasicAbreviations. *)

  (* In LD, the expansion of certain abbreviations (e.g. binding conditionals)
  involve "gamma" variables decorated by variables and expressions, such that
  the "gamma" variables are distinct from the decorating variables and from
  the free variables of the decorating expressions. As explained in spec
  TypesAndExpressions, here we simply decorate abbreviation variables with
  integers. Thus, in order to fulfill the distinctness requirement, we define
  an op that takes as argument a (finite) set of variables and returns the
  abbreviation variable decorated by the minimum natural number that does not
  decorate any abbreviation variable in the argument set. *)
