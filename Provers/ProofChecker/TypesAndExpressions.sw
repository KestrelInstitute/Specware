  (* As mentioned in spec Primitives, we add the distinguished fields and
  variables to the user ones via meta type sums.

  LD postulates "pi" names, indexed by positive natural numbers, to capture
  natural literal fields for product types. Since, as explained in README.txt,
  we avoid subtypes such as PosNat, we use integers.

  LD postulates "gamma", "psi", and "phi" names, used as bound variables in
  the expressions that define abbreviations. The "gamma" names may be primed,
  indexed by positive natural numbers, and indexed by variables and
  expressions. This variety is motivated by clarity of exposition in LD, but
  here it is sufficient to introduce variable names for abbreviations that are
  indexed by integers (again, we avoid naturals or positive naturals). *)

    | user UserField

  (* Types depend on expressions, which depend on types. So, we first declare
  the meta types for types and expressions, and then define them below. *)

  (* Unlike LD, we do not impose certain requirements (e.g. that the fields of
  a record type must be distinct) in the syntax. We incorporate such
  requirements into the inference rules, thus keeping the syntax simpler and
  avoiding subtypes, as explained in README.txt.

  Another difference with LD is that we factor fields separately from the
  component types of record types, i.e. we have two sequences instead of a
  sequence of pairs. This makes the syntax a little simpler. The requirement
  that the two sequences have the same length are incorporated into the
  inference rules. *)

  (* Unlike LD, here projectors are decorated by types, not necessarily record
  types. Again, this keeps the syntax simpler. The inference rules require the
  decorating types to be of the appropriate form. *)

  necessarily least ones. We enforce least ones by means of a (quite verbose)
  induction axiom on types and expressions. *)
