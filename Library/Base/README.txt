The specs in this directory, together with the file Base.sw in the parent
directory, constitute the Specware base libraries. These are basic libraries of
general use, including types for whose values there is special syntax in
Metaslang (e.g. numbers and list displays).

This directory also includes some refinements from which Lisp code can be
automatically generated by Specware. In fact, Specware's Lisp code generator
automatically applies these refinements just before generating Lisp code.

The file structure.ppt provides a graphical representation of the Specware units
defined in the .sw files in this directory and of their relationships:

- a solid arrow from a spec X to a spec Y indicates that Y directly imports X;

- a dotted arrow labeled by a morphism M from a spec X to a spec Y indicates
that M goes from X to Y.
