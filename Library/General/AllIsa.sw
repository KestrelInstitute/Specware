%% Note: This spec imports all specs in this library for which we can
%% generate Isabelle files.  See the comments in All.sw for the
%% reasons why other files' Isabelle obligations fail to go through.

%% Note that several of these declare the same type, X, so 'qualifying' is used to prevent name clashes:
import (Empty qualifying Type#Empty)
import (Finite qualifying Type#Finite)
import (Infinite qualifying Type#Infinite)
%% Without the use of 'qualifying', importing both of these would likely result in an inconsistent spec:
import (CountablyInfinite qualifying Type#CountablyInfinite)
import (UncountablyInfinite qualifying Type#UncountablyInfinite)
