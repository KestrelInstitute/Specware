The specs in this directory, together with the file General.sw in the parent
directory, constitute the Specware general libraries. These are libraries of
general use, consisting of mundane mathematical concepts and data structures.
This directory also includes some refinements from which Lisp code can be
automatically generated by Specware.

The file structure.ppt provides a graphical representation of the Specware units
that comprise the Specware general library and of their relationships:

- a solid arrow from a spec X to a spec Y indicates that Y directly imports X;

- a dotted arrow labeled by a morphism M from a spec X to a spec Y indicates
that M goes from X to Y;

- two dashed arrows from a spec X and a morphism M to a spec Y indicate that Y
is obtained via spec substitution of M into X.
