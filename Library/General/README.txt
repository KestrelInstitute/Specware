This directory contains libraries of general use, consisting of mundane
mathematical concepts and data structures, along with some refinements from
which Lisp code can be automatically generated by Specware.

The files structure.ppt/pdf provide a graphical representation of the Specware
units defined in the .sw files in this directory and of their relationships:

- a solid arrow from a spec X to a spec Y indicates that Y directly imports X;

- a dotted arrow labeled by a morphism M from a spec X to a spec Y indicates
that M goes from X to Y;

- two dashed arrows from a spec X and a morphism M to a spec Y indicate that Y
is obtained via spec substitution of M into X.
