This directory contains libraries of general use, consisting of mundane
mathematical concepts and data structures, along with some refinements from
which code can be generated.

The file dependencies.pdf provides a graphical representation of the Specware
units defined in the .sw files in this directory and of their dependencies. An
arrow from a unit X to a unit Y indicates that unit Y directly references
(i.e. depends on) unit X.
