(*                 
             State-Based/Coalgebraic Fixpoint Iterators

  This specification introduces notation for State-Based Fixpoints of
  a monotone state transformer.  The spec refines the state by adding
  a new observation of a partial order (Set X).  The iterator evolves
  the state to a least/greatest fixpoint of the new observation.

  See also the notes on iterators in fixpoint.sw

  issues: sblfp should leave the state unchanged except for the st2po
  value?  but if the state has complex invariants, the the iteration
  must make necessary/minimal updates to state to preserve them.  For
  GC, the problem is to compute the reachability set of live nodes
  from the roots; there are no invariant that entangle the live nodes
  with the underlying state, so the rest of the state remains fixed
  (in a stw collector).  The point of using a coalgebraic spec is to
  force single-threadedness on the iteration and
  state-changing/side-effecting updates.

  Are the intermediate states along the iteration visible?  i.e. so
  that invariant properties must be maintained?
