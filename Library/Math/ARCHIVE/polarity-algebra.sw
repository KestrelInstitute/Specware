(*  
                     Polarity Algebra

  Polarities form a bounded lattice of size four.  As such it has a
  partial order, meet, join, plus univeral upper and lower bounds. It
  also has a complement operator that is slightly different than that
  needed to make the lattice a boolean algebra.

  The Polarity algebra serves as the abstraction domain for polarity
  analysis by abstract interpretation.

(* The polarity elements can be given the following interpretations:

    bot - unknown polarity
    pos - positive polarity, corresponding to monotonicity
    neg - negative polarity, corresponding to antimonotonicity
    top - mixed polarity, corresponding to substitutivity

 The partial order of the lattice induces the following structure:

      top (or 0 or =)
     /   \
   pos   neg
     \   /
      bot (or unknown)
