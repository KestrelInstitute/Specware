(* This file contains some example Specware derivations of C programs
from specifications via stepwise refinement,
using the model of C features in spec CModel.

In general, a C function with N >= 0 arguments and non-void return type
is specified by a Specware op of the form

  op f (state:State, arg1:Value, ..., argN:Value | ...): State * (Value | ...)

and a C function with N >= 0 arguments and void return type
is specified by a Specware op of the form

  op f (state:State, arg1:Value, ..., argN:Value | ...): State

where in both cases the state is threaded through the op
and the subtype conditions are used to define the C types of the arguments
(and of the result, if any).
See examples below for details. *)

import CModel

(* This spec does not contain an example.
It defines utility concepts used in the examples in the specs below. *)

(* A buffer is often passed to a C function in the form of two arguments:
(1) a pointer to the first element of the buffer;
(2) the length, i.e. the number of elements, of the buffer.
The pointer normally points to
some element (not necessarily the first) of some array,
i.e. the buffer is part of an array;
the length should not exceed the number of remaining elements in the array.
As a special case, the pointer could point to
an object that is not an element of an array,
but in that case the length should not exceed 1;
pointer arithmetic with this object works in the same way
as with an array of length 1 [ISO 6.5.6/7].
As an even more special case,
the length could be 0 and in that case the pointer is irrelevant.
The following ops formalize reading from and writing to a buffer
identified by pointer and length values. *)

(* The length is normally passed as an integer value,
but in the case of an output buffer
(i.e. a buffer intended for writing by the function)
the length could be passed as a pointer to an integer object,
which initially contains the maximum length of the output buffer
and which the function sets to the actual length prior to returning.
The following op reads the length of a buffer
from an integer value or from a pointer value.
The length must be non-negative. *)

(* The following op reads the values in a buffer from (part of) an array.
The ptr value must be a pointer whose object designator is a subscript;
readObject is applied not to the object designator
(which would just yield the array element),
but to the designator of the enclosing array object,
from which a portion of the element values is extracted and returned. *)
