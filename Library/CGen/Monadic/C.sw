%section (* Introduction *)

(* We formalize a subset of C, which we will incrementally extend as needed.

Our formalization is based on the C11 standard, i.e. ISO/IEC 9899, "Information
technology - Programming languages - C", Second edition (2011-12-15).

In the comments in this spec, we reference the ISO standard as '[ISO]', possibly
including (dotted) (sub)section numbers (e.g. '[ISO 6.5.9]') and paragraph
numbers separated by '/' (e.g. '[ISO 6.5.9/2]'). We use ',' to indicate multiple
sub-references (e.g. '[ISO 6.5.4/3, 5.2.1]') and we use '-' to indicate ranges
of contiguous sub-references (e.g. '[ISO 6.5.4-6.5.6]' is the same as '[ISO
6.5.4, 6.5.5, 6.5.6]'). *)


%section (* Environment *)

(* Some aspects of the C language depend on the environment [ISO 5], i.e. on the
implementation. From the point of view of our formalized C subset, we partition
these environmental aspects into three groups:

1. aspects for which our formalization makes a specific choice out of the ones
allowed by [ISO];

2. aspects for which our formalization allows all the choices allowed by [ISO];

3. aspects for which our formalization neither makes a specific choice nor
allows all the choices, but instead tags as 'non-standard'.

The significance of the first group is that our formal model captures only those
implementations of the C language that make the same choices for the aspects in
the group. The significance of the second group is that our formal model can be
instantiated to capture different implementations that make different choices
for the aspects in the group. The third group consists of run-time behaviors
that are not prescribed by [ISO] (e.g. the behavior of signed addition when the
true result is not representable): our formalization denotes such behaviors as
'non-standard', and anything that depends on those behaviors is denoted as
'non-standard' as well.

The following subsections describe our choices for the aspects in the first
group and introduce underspecified Specware constants to capture the aspects in
the second group. The third group is handled later, in the part of the
formalization that formalizes the semantics. *)


%subsection (* Character sets *)

(* We assume that both the source and the execution character sets [ISO 5.2.1]
consist of the 128 ASCII characters. These are all members of the basic
character set, which coincides with the extended character set in our model,
i.e. there are no extended characters in our model. *)


%subsection (* Identifier non-digits *)

(* As formalized later, we assume that an identifier non-digit [ISO 6.4.2.1] can
only be a letter [ISO 5.2.1/4] or an underscore. In other words, we exclude
universal character names and "other implementation-defined characters". *)


%subsection (* Bytes and the unsigned char type *)

(* The number of bits that comprise a byte [ISO 3.6] is expressed by CHAR_BIT
[ISO 5.2.4.2.1/1], which must be at least 8. [ISO 5.2.4.2.1/2] constrains
UCHAR_MAX [ISO 5.2.4.2.1/1] to be 2^CHAR_BIT-1, and [ISO 6.2.6.1/3] constrains
unsigned char objects to be represented using a pure binary notation, i.e. to
range from 0 to 2^CHAR_BIT-1. Thus, unsigned char objects are always bytes in C,
and every object consists of 1 or more bytes [ISO 6.2.6.1/4].

In our formalization, we assume that bytes consist of 8 bits (as is common),
i.e. that CHAR_BIT is 8. Consequently, UCHAR_MAX is 255. *)

op CHAR_BIT : Nat = 8

op UCHAR_MAX : Nat = 2 ** CHAR_BIT - 1

theorem UCHAR_MAX_VAL is
  UCHAR_MAX = 255


%subsection (* The signed char type *)

(* The sizeof operator [ISO 6.5.3.4], which returns the size in bytes of its
operand [ISO 6.5.3.4/2], must return 1 when applied to a char, unsigned char, or
signed char object [ISO 6.5.3.4/4]. This implies that signed char objects
consist, like unsigned char objects, of 1 byte, which in our formalization is 8
bits. [ISO 6.2.6.2/2] says that a signed char object must include a sign bit and
that the other (7) bits are divided among value and padding bits. The constraint
that SCHAR_MAX is at least +127 [ISO 5.2.4.2.1/1] implies that all the 7 bits
must be value bits (otherwise it would not be possible to represent +127). Since
no number greater than 127 can be represented in 7 bits, SCHAR_MAX must be
+127. *)

op SCHAR_MAX : Nat = 127

(* There is still a choice on SCHAR_MIN, depending on whether negative signed
char objects are represented as sign and magnitude, two's complement, or one's
complement [ISO 6.2.6.2/2]. In the first and third case, SCHAR_MIN has to be
-127; in the second case, SCHAR_MIN has to be -128. We assume a two's complement
representation. *)

op SCHAR_MIN : Int = -128


%subsection (* The plain char type *)

(* Plain char objects have the same range and representation as either signed
char objects or unsigned char objects [ISO 6.2.5/15]. We leave this choice open
in our model, by introducing an uninterpreted boolean constant that is true iff
plain char objects are signed. We also define its negation, for convenience. *)

op plainCharsAreSigned : Bool

op plainCharsAreUnsigned : Bool = ~ plainCharsAreSigned

(* The values of CHAR_MIN and CHAR_MAX [ISO 5.2.4.2.1/2] depend on the flag just
introduced. *)

op CHAR_MIN : Int = if plainCharsAreSigned then SCHAR_MIN else 0

op CHAR_MAX : Nat = if plainCharsAreSigned then SCHAR_MAX else UCHAR_MAX

(* Note that, regardless of whether plain chars are signed or unsigned, each of
the 128 ASCII characters (which, as stated earlier, constitute our basic
character set) can be stored into a (plain) char and the resulting value is
non-negative [ISO 6.2.5/3]. *)


%subsection (* The other integer types *)

(* The representation of an unsigned integer type other than unsigned char, must
consist of N value bits plus 0 or more padding bits, yielding a range of values
between 0 and 2^N-1 [ISO 6.2.6.2/1]. This constrains the U..._MAX value of each
unsigned integer type to be 2^N-1. We assume that no padding bits are used, so
that the representation consists of exactly N (value) bits. Since every object
(including integers) has a size in bytes [ISO 6.5.3.4/2, 6.2.6.1/4], N must be a
multiple of CHAR_BIT, i.e. 8 as defined above.

We leave the exact number of bits N open, by introducing the following
sizeof_... underspecified constants which express the size, in bytes, of each
unsigned integer type other than unsigned char (which we have covered earlier).
So, for each unsigned integer type, the number of bits N is CHAR_BIT times the
sizeof_... constants introduced below. For convenience, we also define ..._bit
constants that express the size in bits of the types.

The minimum magnitude constraints on the U..._MAX values given in [ISO
5.2.4.2.1/1] correspond to the minimum magnitude constraints on the sizeof_...
constants captured by the axioms below. *)

op sizeof_int   : Nat
op sizeof_long  : Nat
op sizeof_llong : Nat

op short_bits : Nat = sizeof_short * CHAR_BIT
op   int_bits : Nat = sizeof_int   * CHAR_BIT
op  long_bits : Nat = sizeof_long  * CHAR_BIT
op llong_bits : Nat = sizeof_llong * CHAR_BIT

axiom min_sizeof_short is  sizeof_short >= 2
axiom min_sizeof_int   is  sizeof_int   >= 2

axiom min_sizeof_llong is  sizeof_llong >= 8

theorem min_int_bits   is    int_bits >= 16
theorem min_long_bits  is   long_bits >= 32
theorem min_llong_bits is  llong_bits >= 64

op  USHRT_MAX : Nat = 2 ** short_bits - 1
op   UINT_MAX : Nat = 2 **   int_bits - 1
op  ULONG_MAX : Nat = 2 **  long_bits - 1
op ULLONG_MAX : Nat = 2 ** llong_bits - 1

theorem min_USHRT_MAX  is  USHRT_MAX  >= 2 ** 16 - 1
theorem min_UINT_MAX   is  UINT_MAX   >= 2 ** 16 - 1
theorem min_ULONG_MAX  is  ULONG_MAX  >= 2 ** 32 - 1
theorem min_ULLONG_MAX is  ULLONG_MAX >= 2 ** 64 - 1

(* The signed integer types use the same amount of storage as their unsigned
counterparts [ISO 6.2.5/6]. Thus, the sizeof_... and ..._bits constants
introduced above also apply to the signed integer types, not only the unsigned
ones. This is why the names of those constants make no reference to
(un)signedness.

Similarly to the signed char type, we assume that the other signed integer types
use a two's complement representation with no padding bits [ISO 6.2.6.2/2].
Thus, the sizeof_... constants determine the following values for the ..._MIN
and ..._MAX limits of the signed integer types [ISO 5.2.4.2.1/1]. *)

op  SHRT_MIN : Int = - (2 ** (short_bits - 1))
op   INT_MIN : Int = - (2 ** (  int_bits - 1))
op  LONG_MIN : Int = - (2 ** ( long_bits - 1))
op LLONG_MIN : Int = - (2 ** (llong_bits - 1))

op  SHRT_MAX : Nat =   2 ** (short_bits - 1) - 1
op   INT_MAX : Nat =   2 ** (  int_bits - 1) - 1
op  LONG_MAX : Nat =   2 ** ( long_bits - 1) - 1
op LLONG_MAX : Nat =   2 ** (llong_bits - 1) - 1

theorem min_SHRT_MIN  is   SHRT_MIN <= - (2 ** 15)
theorem min_INT_MIN   is    INT_MIN <= - (2 ** 15)
theorem min_LONG_MIN  is   LONG_MIN <= - (2 ** 31)
theorem min_LLONG_MIN is  LLONG_MIN <= - (2 ** 63)

theorem min_LONG_MAX  is   LONG_MAX >=    2 ** 31 - 1
theorem min_LLONG_MAX is  LLONG_MAX >=    2 ** 63 - 1

(* There are inclusion constraints among the ranges of the integer types [ISO
6.2.5/8], determined by the integer conversion ranks [ISO 6.3.1.1/1]. Given our
assumptions and constants introduced above, these inclusion constraints are
expressed via the following axioms on the sizeof_... constants. *)

axiom sizeof_short_int  is  sizeof_short <= sizeof_int
axiom sizeof_int_long   is  sizeof_int   <= sizeof_long
axiom sizeof_long_llong is  sizeof_long  <= sizeof_llong


%section (* Syntax *)

(* We only formalize abstract syntax, not concrete syntax. *)


%subsection (* Identifiers *)

(* As stated earlier, we assume that an identifier non-digit [ISO 6.4.2.1] can
only be a letter or an underscore. Thus, an identifier [ISO 6.4.2.1] in our C
subset is a non-empty sequence of letters (upper and lower case), digits, and
underscores, starting with a letter or an underscore. Note that the first 128
characters in Specware are the ASCII characters, matching our assumption, stated
earlier, that the source character set in our C subset consists of the 128 ASCII
characters.

Identifiers (as defined in [ISO 6.4.2.1/1]) that are keywords [ISO 6.4.1] become
keywords after preprocessing [ISO 6.4.2.1/4]. So the predicate ppIdentifier?
defined below captures preprocessing identifiers [ISO 6.4/1], while the
predicate identifier? and the type Identifier capture identifiers after
preprocessing. *)

%subsection (* Types *)

(* Our C subset features the following types [ISO 6.2.5]: the standard signed
and unsigned integer types, the (plain) char type, structure types, pointer
types, array types, and the void type. Each of the signed/unsigned
short/int/long/longlong types can be denoted via multiple, equivalent
combinations of type specifiers [ISO 6.7.2]; even though some of these types may
have identical representations in an implementation, they are nevertheless
different types [ISO 6.2.5/14]. A structure type is denoted by its optional tag,
where a None tag indicates an anonymous struct, as well as the names and types
of its members [ISO 6.2.5/20]. In order to handle recursive struct types, we
allow the member types in a struct type with tag S to refer to that whole struct
type just by the name S, without containing the member types of S; e.g., the
type T_struct (Some "S", ("f", T_pointer (T_structName "S"))) defines a struct
type for a simple linked list. An array type includes the number of elements
[ISO 6.2.5/20]; our C subset only includes array types with known size. *)

(* Since u/U are not (hex) digits or the prefix 0x/0X, to test whether an
integer constant includes an unsigned suffix it suffices to check whether an
integer suffix occurs anywhere in the constant. Analogous reasoning applies to
ll/LL long long suffixes. For the l/L long suffixes, we use the same test, after
making sure that there are no long long suffixes, because l/L is a substring of
ll/LL. *)

the suffixes and the base of the constant. The type of the constant is the first

%subsection (* Unary operators *)

(* Of the unary operators in [ISO 6.5.3], our C subset includes the address and

  | UOp_NEG    % logical negation !


%subsection (* Binary operators *)

(* Even though the grammar in [ISO] has no explicit non-terminal for binary
operators (unlike unary operators [ISO 6.5.3/1]), in our formalization we
introduce a notion of binary operator to enable a more compact definition of
expressions later. Our C subset includes all the operators in [ISO
6.5.5-6.5.14]. *)

type BinaryOp =
  | BinOp_MUL   % multiplication *
  | BinOp_DIV   % division       /

  | BinOp_IOR   % bitwise inclusive OR  |
  | BinOp_LAND  % logical AND &&
  | BinOp_LOR   % logical OR ||


%subsection (* Expressions *)

(* Our C subset includes only expressions which do not have side effects. This
is because the order in which side effects occur in expressions is unspecified
[ISO 6.5/2], but trying to model exactly when such unspecified behavior could
occur is complex and difficult. Thus, any side-effecting expressions (such as
assignment expressions) are promoted to statements in our formalism.

Our C subset includes the following kinds of expressions [ISO 6.5]: identifiers
[ISO 6.5.1/1], integer constants [ISO 6.5.1/1], unary expressions using the
unary operators introduced above, binary expressions using the binary operators
introduced above, conditional expressions [ISO 6.5.15], structure member
expressions (i.e. the '.' and '->' operators, respectively denoted by the
constructors 'member' and 'memberp', where 'p' suggests that the left operand
must be a pointer, as required for '->') [ISO 6.5.2.3], array subscripting [ISO
6.5.2.1], and cast expressions [ISO 6.5.4].

C expressions are typed, and the type of an expression determines the meaning of
the value accessed by it [ISO 6.2.5/1]. Thus, our Expressions contain enough
additional information to determine the type of an expression; this really only
includes the return type of conditional expressions.
*)

  | E_member    Expression * Identifier
  | E_memberp   Expression * Identifier
  | E_subscript Expression * Expression
  | E_cast      TypeName * Expression


%subsection (* Type names *)

(* The C syntax of object declarations [ISO 6.7] is complicated by the fact that
the declared type of an identifier may be indicated by syntax "around" the
identifier, as opposed to preceding the identifier completely as in other
languages. For example, to declare x to be an array of 3 ints, the C syntax is
'int x[3]', as opposed to something like 'int[3] x'. As another example, to
declare y to be a pointer to an array of 2 ints, the C syntax is 'int *y[2]', as
opposed to something like 'int[3]* y'. (The rationale for the C syntax appears
to be the desire of mirroring the syntax of the expressions that correspond to
the type.)

In the abstract syntax, it is more convenient to separate the identifier from
its declared type completely, instead of potentially mixing them as in the
concrete syntax. In our formalization, we could just use (Specware) values of
(Specware) type Type, except that those do not cover the syntactic case of a
typedef name [ISO 6.7.8]. That is, if the program includes a 'typedef int T;'
declaration, T is a synonym of int in the scope of that declaration, and thus a
further declaration could use T, as in 'T x;'. Typedef names are not part of
type Type, and so if we were to use type Type to model a declaration, we would
be unable to include type identifiers. Extending type Type itself to include
typedef names does not seem appropriate because type Type is meant to capture
the actual types of the C language described in [ISO 6.2.5], while typedef names
are just synonyms.

In essence, to model an object declaration in the abstract syntax, we want to
pair an identifier with either a type (i.e. a value of type Type) or a typedef
name (or a combination thereof, e.g. pointer to typedef name). This notion
corresponds to a type name [ISO 6.7.7], which is syntactically a declaration
that omits the identifier [ISO 6.7.7/2]. Note that suitable sequences of type
specifiers [ISO 6.7.2] can denote most types (of type Type) and also typedef
names, but cannot denote pointers and arrays (which in fact have their own
declarators that follow the type specifiers [ISO 6.7.6.1, 6.7.6.2]), so we could
not use type specifiers to model declarations in our abstract syntax.

Abstracting from the concrete syntactic peculiarities of type names [ISO 6.7.7],
we define a type name as follows. This is the same definition as type Type,
extended with typedef names. Note that the recursion implies that we can form
pointers and arrays of typedef names.
 *)

(* In a type name, a struct can also be referred to by name *)
type StructName = | NamedStruct Identifier

%subsection (* Statements *)

(* Our C subset features expression statements [ISO 6.8.3] that are: (i) simple
assignment expressions [ISO 6.5.16.1] (whose left and right operands are
expressions in our C subset); (ii) simple assignment expressions whose left
operand is an expression in our C subset but whose right operand is a function
call [ISO 6.5.2.2]; or (iii) function calls [ISO 6.5.2.2]. Cases (ii) and (iii)
are consolidated in constructor 'call' below, where the left operand is an
optional expression (in our C subset) and the right operand consists of the
function being called plus a list of argument expressions. By modeling
assignments and function calls as statements in our model (vs. expressions as in
full C), we limit such expressions to occur at the top level (or second level
from the top, in the case of a function call assigned to an expression), i.e. as
expression statements. In particular, we exclude multiple assignments like 'a =
b = ...' Note also that, by having function calls not be expressions in our
subset, we maintain expressions free of side effects.

Besides these expression statements, our C subset includes 'if' selection
statements [ISO 6.8.4.1], 'return' jump statements [ISO 6.8.6.4], 'while', and
'do' iteration statements [ISO 6.8.5], and compound statements (i.e. blocks)
[ISO 6.8.2]. (We currently expect that "for" statements are just treated as
"while" statements, possibly with additional statements added before the loop
and at the end of each iteration of the loop.)

Our 'if' statement captures both the variant with 'else' and the
variant without 'else', based on the presence of the second, optional statement.
A 'return' statement [ISO 6.8.6.4] includes an optional expression.

Besides statements, we only allow object declarations as block items [ISO
6.8.2], not other kinds of declarations. *)

%subsection (* Declarations and External Declarations *)

(* We model an object [ISO 3.15] declaration [ISO 6.7] as a pair consisting of a
type name and an identifier. Such a named object is commonly referred to as
'variable', even though [ISO] seems to carefully avoid this term.

Our model of object declarations excludes type qualifiers [ISO 6.7.3],
initializers [ISO 6.7.6], and all explicit storage class specifiers [ISO 6.7.1]
other than "extern", which is here represented as a Boolean indicating whether
extern is present or not. Our model also excludes any declarator other than a
simple identifier [ISO 6.7.6], since these can all be modeled using simple
identifiers with more complex types. *)

type ObjectDeclaration =
 {ObjDecl_type : TypeName,
  ObjDecl_name : Identifier,
  ObjDecl_isExtern : Bool}

(* [ISO 6.7.2.1/1] uses the term 'struct-declaration' for the members of a
structure or union type specifier. This term seems unfortunate because it is a
declaration for a member of a structure, not for the whole structure, and it
also applies to unions, which are not structures. Thus, we prefer to deviate
from the [ISO 6.7.2.1/1] terminology and use the term 'member declaration',
which we model as a pair consisting of a type name and an identifier. *)

type MemberDeclaration =
  {MemDecl_type : TypeName,
   MemDecl_name : Identifier}

(* We model a structure specifier [ISO 6.7.2.1] as a pair consisting of a tag
(which is an identifier) and a list of member declarations. Thus, we require the
tag and the members to be always present and we exclude bit fields. *)

(* In our C subset, a (function) parameter declaration [ISO 6.7.6/1] consists of
a type name and a name. A parameter list [ISO 6.7.6/1] is a list of parameter
declarations. In our C subset, a parameter list is also a parameter type list
[ISO 6.7.6/1], because we disallow ellipsis in function definitions. *)

type ParameterDeclaration = TypeName * Identifier
type ParameterList = List ParameterDeclaration

(* We combine function declarations [ISO 6.7.6.3] and definitions [ISO 6.9.1]
into the same type, which contains a return type (name), a name, a parameter
list, and an optional body, where the body is supplied for a function definition
and not supplied for a function declaration. We also support the "extern"
storage class specifier for function declarations, allowing functions to call
other functions in different translation units, but it is an error for a
function definition to be marked "extern". *)

type FunctionDeclaration =
 {FDef_retType    : TypeName,

(* The following are the declarations [ISO 6.7] that, as defined later, can
appear at the top level in a translation unit in our C subset. *)

(* Our C subset has no preprocessing directives [ISO 6.10], so a preprocessing
translation unit [ISO 5.1.1.1/1] is the same as a translation unit [ISO 6.9] --
essentially, a file.

A translation unit consists of zero or more external declarations, where an
external declaration is either a function definition or a declaration as defined
earlier [ISO 6.9/1]. *)

%section (* Semantics *)

(* Besides syntax and syntactic constraints, [ISO] describes the semantics (i.e.
execution) of C programs. *)


%subsection (* Object and Function Designators *)

(* Each object declaration in a program in our C subset introduces an object
[ISO 3.15]. When such an object is a structure, its members are subobjects of
the object, which can be independently written to via a suitable lvalue [ISO
6.3.2.1/1]. Similarly, when the object is an array, its elements are subobjects
and they can be written independently via a suitable lvalue. This recursively
applies to members and elements of structure members and array elements.

For all of these objects, we introduce the object designators, as entities that
refer to these objects. Intuitively, an object designator is a pointer to an
object in the heap, and, in fact, this is how pointer values are defined below.

At the top level of the nesting of subobjects inside other objects are the
global variables, the local (i.e., stack) variables, and the heap-allocated
objects (returned by, e.g., malloc). These three classes of top-level objects
correspond to the three sorts of storage [ISO 6.2.4] in C (not including thread
storage, which we do not support here): static storage for global variables,
automatic storage for local (i.e., stack) variables, and allocated storage for
heap-allocated objects. Top-level objects in static and automatic storage are
referred to by name, since each object in static and automatic storage
corresponds to a, respectively, global or local variable. However, because of
variable shadowing, the same name can refer to multiple objects. Thus, to form a
unique reference to a named top-level object, a variable name must be combined
with a "scope designator" that specifies either global or local scope,
corresponding to static or automatic variables, respectively. For local scope,
the scope designator must additionally specify which scope is being referred to,
using a ScopeID. *)

type ScopeID = | ScopeID Nat

type ScopeDesignator =
  | GlobalScope
  | LocalScope ScopeID

type AllocatedID = | AllocatedID Nat

type ObjectDesignator =
  | OD_Top        ScopeDesignator * Identifier
  | OD_Allocated  AllocatedID
  | OD_Member     ObjectDesignator * Identifier
  | OD_Subscript  ObjectDesignator * Nat


(* A function designator [ISO 6.3.2.1] is defined to be any expression that has
function type. We diverge slightly from this definition, and define a function
designator to be any identifier that has function type. Note that any function
designator in the C spec will always evaluate to the function defined by some
named function definition somewhere in the program, and thus the value of an
expression of function type (the C spec's definition of "function designator")
will always be an element of the FunctionDesignator type defined here. Later,
when we define the Monad type, we will define a lookup table for finding the
actual monadic function associated with a FunctionDesignator. *)

%subsection (* Values *)

(* We represent integers in values with a tagged integer type, because values in
C are always interpreted at a specific type [ISO 3.19] and the type of an
integer affects the semantics of C in a lot of places *)
type TypedInt = { ty_i : Type * Int |
                   integerType? ty_i.1 && ty_i.2 in? rangeOfIntegerType ty_i.1 }

(* We now define the values. The C spec defines a value as the contents of an
object when interpreted at a specific type [ISO 3.19], where an object is a
region of data storage [ISO 3.15]. To reflect this, we define values to also
contain (enough information to reconstruct) the type at which they are being
viewed.

A structure (value) consists of a list of members, each with a name and a value.
(We disallow unnamed members, to simplify structs.) It also consists a
StructType for the struct.

A pointer (value) is an element of the Pointer type defined above, along with a
type tag, identifying the element type at which this pointer is being viewed.
Note that this element type could actually be different from the actual type
of the object designated by the pointer in the heap.

An array value consists of a list of values, which give the elements of the
array, along with the element type of those values.

Null pointers [ISO 6.3.2.3/3] are represented separately from pointers,
and also contain the type at which they are being viewed.

Finally, our values contain trap representations [ISO 3.19.4], which are
represented with the V_undefined constructor. These are objects that do not
denote an actual value of a specified type, and are used for, e.g., the initial
values of objects with automatic storage (i.e., stack variables). *)

type Value =
  | V_int         TypedInt
  | V_struct      StructType * List (Identifier * Value)
  | V_pointer     Type * Pointer
  | V_array       Type * List Value
  | V_nullpointer Type
  | V_undefined   Type


(* We can extract from a value the type at which we are viewing it *)
op typeOfValue (val:Value) : Type =
  case val of
  | V_int (ty, _)            -> ty
  | V_struct (tag, _)        -> T_struct tag
  | V_pointer (ty, _)        -> T_pointer ty
  | V_array (ty, vals)       -> T_array (ty, length vals)
  | V_nullpointer ty         -> T_pointer ty
  | V_undefined ty           -> ty


(* We lift some of the predicates that classify types to predicates that
classify values. Note that undefined values of the correct types are
included. *)

op integerValue? (val:Value) : Bool =
  integerType? (typeOfValue val)

op arithmeticValue? (val:Value) : Bool =
  arithmeticType? (typeOfValue val)

    | None -> compatibleTypes? (T_void, tp)


%subsection (* Storage *)

(* An object is a region of storage [ISO 3.15]. When the object has a name, that
name identifies that region of storage. We introduce the notion of named storage
as a mapping from names of objects to the values stored in those objects. Recall
that values in C are object contents viewed at a specific type [ISO 3.19]; the
type at which an object is being viewed in a named storage is the effective type
of the object [ISO 6.5/6], which is the same as the type at which the object was
declared. *)

type NamedStorage = FiniteMap (Identifier, Value)

(* A "local scope" is a runtime instance of a block scope [ISO 6.2.1]. Each time
a function is executed, a new local scope is created for the function itself,
and, every time a sub-block is entered in that function, a new local scope is
created for that sub-block scope. Local scopes have a nesting, mirroring that of
the block scopes they are instances of; i.e., the local scope created for a
particular block always has a local scope for the block containing it. The top
local scope of a function always has the global scope as its parent. This is
captured by using a ScopeDesignator to designate the parent scope of a given
local scope. *)

type LocalScope = {scope_bindings : NamedStorage,
                   scope_parent   : ScopeDesignator }

(* As mentioned in the comments for type 'ObjectDesignator', our model of
storage includes allocated objects, which are identified by the AllocatedID type
introduced earlier. The allocated storage is modeled as a list, where
AllocatedIDs, which are just natural numbers, are used to index into this
list. In order to model deallocation of objects, the allocated storage list
contains optional values, where "None" indicates a deallocated object. This is
to prevent another allocation from re-using an AllocatedID. Allocated objects
also do not have a declared type, and so can change type when they are assigned
to [ISO 6.5/6]; the only restriction is the size of the allocated object, which
does not change, and so this size is included with the allocated object. *)
type AllocatedStorage = List (Option (Value * Nat))

(* We model the global, dynamic storage of a program as containing three fields
corresponding to the three storage durations [ISO 6.2.4] of objects (excluding
thread-local storage, which we do not model here). The static storage, for
global variables and function definitions, is modeled as a named storage. The
automatic storage, for local variables inside function bodies and nested blocks,
is modeled as a list of local scopes, where ScopeID N refers to the Nth element
of this list. To model the fact that automatic scopes are destroyed /
deallocated when the block they belong to is exited, elements of the automatic
storage list are actually of Option type, where "None" indicates a scope
that has been deallocated. The storage for allocated objects is modeled
with the AllocatedStorage type introduced above.
*)

type Storage =
  {static    : NamedStorage,
   automatic : List (Option LocalScope),
   allocated : AllocatedStorage}


%subsection (* Outcomes *)

(* FIXME HERE: update this documentation! *)

(* [ISO] prescribes the outcomes of certain computations, while leaving the
outcomes of other computations undefined [ISO 3.4.3] or implementation-defined
[ISO 3.4.1]. In our formalization, we collectively regard undefined and
implementation-defined outcomes as errors, since we cannot prove anything
about these outcomes.

The syntactic constraints checked at compile time guarantee that certain
situations will never occur at run time. An example of this kind of situation is
referencing a variable that is not in scope. Thus, execution needs not deal with
such situations, i.e. the semantics of the C constructs in [ISO] is only defined
for those instances of the constructs that satisfy the compile-time checks.
Correspondingly, our formalization could restrict the specification of execution
to only the situations allowed by the compile-time checks. However, it seems
simpler to specify execution in all situations, and have the Specware functions
return a special error result to indicate that the situation should not arise if
all the compile-time checks are satisfied. We can then prove that no error ever
arises when all the compile-time checks (formalized earlier) are satisfied.

emw4: We defer the low-level semantic definitions of C computations to a monad,
which is defined externally to this spec. This monad must of course satisfy the
monad laws, as specified by the monad spec /Library/Structures/Data/Monad, but
must additionally provide features for error-reporting, for mutating some global
state, for reading lexically-scoped information, and for representing
non-terminating computations. These features are all specified in the following
extensions of the monad spec. Note that, by leaving the Monad type abstract, we
can instantiate it with different actual monads depending on the "computational
features" we want to model; e.g., concurrency, file operations, etc. *)

op [a,b] mapM (f : a -> Monad b) (xs : List a) : Monad (List b) =
   case xs of
     | [] -> return []
     | x :: xs' ->
       {new_x <- f x;
        new_xs <- mapM f xs';
        return (new_x :: new_xs)}

     | [] -> Some []
     | x :: xs' ->
       {new_x <- f x;
        new_xs <- mapM_opt f xs';
        Some (new_x :: new_xs)}


%subsubsection (* Non-Local Exits *)

(* These are all the non-local exits in Monad, i.e., the "ways" in which a
computation in Monad can bypass the normal return mechanism, and return control
back to the most recent enclosing catchErrs construct.

The first three represent, respectively, undefined behavior [ISO 3.4.3],
unspecified as well as implementation-defined behavior [ISO 3.4.1, ISO 3.4.4],
and behaviors that are not implemented by this formalization. These are not ever
meant to be caught by catchErrs, because they represent situations that it is
not generally possible to even detect in a C program, and any use of catchErrs
below always immediately re-raises any of these non-local exits. The reason we
model these sorts of behaviors as non-local exits is because, in any situation
where the standard prescribes such a behavior, our formalism can no longer say
anything about the remainder of the computation.

Note that there is a subtle difference between "error", which represents
undefined behavior, and "nonstd", which represents unspecified and/or
implementation-defined behavior: in the former case, the standard does allow a
program to immediately terminate execution, or basically do anything, so our
formalization in a sense agrees with the standard; while in the latter case, the
standard gives a set of choices of possible behaviors, none of which is
terminating the program, and so in a sense our formalization disagrees with the
standard, but in a way where it detects and represents this disagreement.
Behaviors that are not implemented by our formalization are similar to "nonstd"
in this respect.

The final non-local exit is used to model a return statement, which immediately
transfers control to the caller of a function. A return also passes an optional
result value to the caller, which is captured by having Err_return take an
optional value. Note that this is not really an "error", even though it is
captured by the "Err" type here. *)

%subsubsection (* Translation Environment *)

(* C programs are translated in a "translation environment" [ISO 5.1.1], though
not much is specified about translation environments. In our formalization, the
translation environment contains information about the typedefs and struct tags
that the compiler has processed so far, as well as a global lookup table for
named function definitions. We separate this information from the global state
of the program, which was defined above as a Storage, because intuitively this
information is static and lexical, not dynamic; i.e., different functions
compiled in different translation units, although they share the same storage,
can use different typedefs and structure tags. To model the availability of this
information, we use a reader monad with type "TranslationEnv", defined below. *)

(* To define the TranslationEnv type, we start by defining a symbol table for
type definitions, i.e. an association of types to typedef names. *)

type TypedefTable = FiniteMap (Identifier, Type)

(* A structure type, introduced by a structure specifier, consists of
an ordered list of typed members, each of which is modeled as a pair
of a member name and its type. A symbol table for structure specifiers
associates typed members to structure tags (which are identifiers). *)

type StructTable = FiniteMap (Identifier, StructMemberTypes)

(* A function table is a mapping from identifiers to monadic functions on zero
or more values. These monadic functions are restricted so that they cannot
depend on the translation environment, a condition which is specified by
requiring the monadic computations to be insensitive to the localR monadic
operation. This condition is necessary when we actually try to build a concrete
Monad type, in order to break the circularity between the Monad and
FunctionTable types: the Monad type must contain (a type isomorphic to) the
FunctionTable type, which in turn contains the Monad type. In fact, the Monad
type must contain (a type isomorphic to) the FunctionTable type in a negative
position, since Monad is a MonadReader for a type containing FunctionTable.

The reason this condition breaks the circularity is that it allows Monad to be
define as something like the following (using Haskell's ReaderT transformer):

type Monad a = ReaderT (TypedefTable * StructTable * UnderFunctionTable) UnderMonad a
type UnderFunctionTable =
   List (Identifier * (List Value -> MonadUnder Value))

for some underlying monad UnderMonad. With this definition of Monad, we have
that UnderMonad a is isomorphic to { m:Monad a | fa (f) localR f m = m }, where
lifting through the ReaderT transformer does one direction of the isomorphism
and applying a Monad computation m to any TranslationEnv (an operation also know
as "runReaderT" in Haskell) is the other direction of the isomorphism. *)

%subsection (* Conversions *)

%subsubsection (* Integer conversions *)

(* An integer value can be converted into (a value of) an(other) integer type
[ISO 6.3.1.3].

The conversion is described in terms of the mathematical value of the integer.
If the new type can represent it, the (mathematical) value is unchanged [ISO
6.3.1.3/1].

Otherwise, the outcome depends on whether the new type is unsigned or not. Note
that the new type could be 'char', which is classified as neither a signed nor
an unsigned integer type [ISO 6.2.5/4, 6.2.5/6] (cf. ops 'signedIntegerType?'
and 'unsignedIntegerType?'). But according to [ISO 6.2.5/15] the 'char' type has
the same behavior as either signed or unsigned 'char', and this choice is
captured by ops 'plainCharsAreSigned' and 'plainCharsAreUnsigned', introduced
earlier.

If the type is unsigned, we find the (unique) mathematical integer i' that is
representable in the type and differs from the original mathematical integer i
by k times the maximum representable integer in the type plus 1, where k can be
negative or positive, capturing the repeated subtraction or addition mentioned
in [ISO 6.3.1.3/2].

If the new type is signed, the outcome is non-standard [ISO 6.3.1.3/3]. *)

op convertInteger (val:Value, ty:Type | integerType? ty) : Monad Value =
  {i <- intOfValue val;
   if i in? rangeOfIntegerType ty then
     return (valueOfInt (ty, i))
   else if unsignedIntegerType? ty || (plainCharsAreUnsigned && ty = T_char) then
     let max1:Nat = maxOfIntegerType ty + 1 in
     let i':Int = the(i':Int) i' in? rangeOfIntegerType ty &&
                              (ex(k:Int) i' = i + k * max1) in
     return (valueOfInt (ty, i'))
   else
     raiseErr Err_nonstd}

(* In terms of the bits that comprise the integer values, integer conversions
correspond to zero-extension, sign-extension, truncation, or no change.

Zero-extension occurs when the original value is unsigned and the new type has
more bits than the original value, regardless of whether the new type is signed
or unsigned.

Sign-extension occurs when the original value is signed and the new type has
more bits than the original value, regardless of whether the new type is signed
or unsigned.

Truncation occurs when the new type has fewer bits than the original value,
regardless of whether the new type is signed or unsigned and whether the
original value is signed or unsigned.

No change occurs when the new type has the same number of bits as the original
value, regardless of whether the new type is signed or unsigned and whether the
original value is signed or unsigned. *)

     return (ty, i1, i2)}
  else
    error


%subsubsection (* Casts *)

(* Casts convert an expression from one scalar type to another [ISO 6.5.4].
Recall that the scalar types are the integer types, the floating-point types
(which we do not include here), and the pointer types.

The case of casting between two integer types was already covered above by
convertInteger.

Converting an integer to a pointer yields an implementation-defined result [ISO
6.3.2.3/5], and could yield a trap representation (i.e., an undefined pointer),
so this is what we do here. This means that integers can never be converted to
pointers. The exception is that converting an expression with value 0 to a
pointer yields a null pointer [ISO 6.3.2.3/3].

Converting a pointer to an integer is implementation-defined, and need not in
fact ever yield an integer in the range of any integer type, in which case the
result is undefined [ISO 6.3.2.3/6]. This is what we do here, meaning that
pointers can never be converted to integers.

Otherwise, we allow any pointer type to be converted to any other pointer type,
as long as they are both object pointer types or both function pointer types.
The only requirement is that, when a pointer is converted to another pointer
type and then back again, the result should be equal to the original value of
the pointer [ISO 6.3.2.3/1, ISO 6.3.2.3/7, ISO 6.3.2.3/8]. We deviate from the
standard slightly, however, in that we ignore alignment [ISO 6.2.8]; in fact,
our formalization acts as if all types had alignment 1. *)
op castValue (tp:Type, val:Value | scalarType? tp) : Monad Value =
  let val_tp = typeOfValue val in
  if (integerType? val_tp && integerType? tp) then

%subsubsection (* Assignment conversions *)

(* In a simple assignment [ISO 6.5.16.1], which is the only form of assignment
we allow in our C subset, the value of the right operand (the one being
assigned) is converted to the type of the left operand (the one being
overwritten) before storing it. In our C subset, with no atomic or qualified
types and no '_Bool' type, this conversion requires the two operands to be [ISO
6.5.16.1/1]: (i) two arithmetic operands; (ii) two compatible structures; (iii)
two pointers to compatible types; (iv) a pointer to a non-void type and a
pointer to void; or (v) a pointer (left) and a null pointer constant (right).

In case (i), the right operand is converted into the type of the left operand
and stored into it. In case (ii), the right operand structure is stored into the
left operand, unchanged, and similarly with case (iii). Case (iv) and (v) are
handled by casting the right-hand side to the left-hand side.

Note that the same conversions apply to conditional expressions [ISO 6.5.15]. *)

%subsection (* Expressions *)

(* A C expression designates a possibly side-effecting computation of a value,
an object designator (i.e., an lvalue), or a function designator [ISO 6.5/1].
(Note that we do not in fact allow side-effects in our expressions, as discussed
above.) We smoosh the latter two into the single case of returning a Pointer,
which is combined with the result type of the expression, as lvalues, like all
expressions, are typed, and in fact the type of an lvalue determines the type of
the object referenced through that lvalue [ISO 6.3.2.1/1]. Further, array
expression values are converted to pointers [ISO 6.3.2.1], except for a few
special cases. *)
type ExpressionValue = {v:Value | ~(arrayValue? v)}
type ExpressionResult =
  | Res_pointer Type * Pointer
  | Res_value   ExpressionValue

(* In all but a handfull of special cases, the result of an expression is
   converted to a value that is not an array or a function [ISO 6.3.2.1].
   Lvalues are converted to the values of the objects designated by them, array
   values are converted to pointers to their first element, and function values
   are converted to pointers to those function values. The first of these
   processes is called lvalue conversion. These conversions are captured here by
   the conversion from an ExpressionResult to a Value.

   The C spec is rather complex and hard to understand in relation to how the
   types of lvalues and the types of the values read from them relate during
   lvalue conversion. The value resulting from lvalue conversion is required to
   have the type of the lvalue [ISO 6.3.2.1/2], but also the lvalue used to
   access an object is required to either have the effective type of the object,
   if any, or character type [ISO 6.5/7]; the effective type of an object is its
   declared type for automatic and static objects and the last type used to
   assign to it, if any, for allocated objects [ISO 6.5/6]. The only way the
   type of an lvalue can differ from the effective type of the object referenced
   by it, however, is through an indirection operator acting on a pointer with
   the "wrong" type, either directly or as the left-hand side of one ore more
   array subscript and/or struct member operations; the only other lvalues are
   identifiers (on the left of zero or more array subscripts and/or struct
   member operations), which always refer to automatic or static objects of the
   same type as that of the identifier. It is still unclear what happens when a
   pointer is dereferenced at the "wrong" type, however; thus, we simply mark
   this behavior as "unimplemented" in our formalization.

   Note, however, that lvalue conversion is actually doing the work of the
   address indirection operator, whose behavior is undefined (i.e., an error) if
   the pointer is "invalid" [ISO 6.5.3.2/4]. This check is implemented by
   reading the value / function referenced by the pointer, and is done before
   the types are compared. Also, for function pointers, the type-check is not
   needed, since the spec seems to indicate [ISO 6.3.2.3/8] that changing the
   type of a function pointer only leads to undefined behavior when the wrong
   function type is called.

   FIXME HERE: still trying to understand the spec on these points; e.g., what
   if we dereference a pointer to a struct at a struct type that is a prefix of
   the struct pointer to? This seems like it must be supported by the
   standard...  *)

(* We now formalize all of expression evaluation, as follows.

FIXME HERE: update this documentation.

FIXME HERE: make sure the types are always correct during evaluation

A identifier (i.e., a variable) [ISO 6.5.1/2] evaluates to the object designator
that the variable references. Note that, in the official C semantics, an
undeclared identifier is an error, and is in fact a violation of syntax; in our
formalization, however, not only is an undeclared identifier valid
syntactically, it can also have a non-erroneous value, specifically in the case
of a global variable from another translation unit that was not declared in the
current translation unit using "extern". However, an undeclared identifier that
does not lead to an error in our formalization will not typecheck in our
formalization, and so in that sense it is "a violation of the syntax".

An integer constant [ISO 6.5.1/3] evaluates to the integer value formalized by
op 'evaluateIntegerConstant'. A unary or binary expression is evaluated using
evaluatorForUnaryOp or evaluatorForBinaryOp, respectively, defined above.

There are two special cases for evaluating the address '&' operator. The first
is that an expression of the form '&*E' evaluates to the same as E, i.e. '&' and
'*' are not applied [ISO 6.5.3.2/3]. The difference between the normal
evaluation procedure and this exception is visible, for instance, when 'E' is
null, or an 'undefined' value, as in this case *E would be undefined (i.e., an
error). The second special case for unary expressions is for an expression of
the form '&E[I]', which yields the same result as E+I [ISO 6.5.3.2/3].

A conditional expression requires a scalar first operand [ISO 6.5.15/2], which
it evaluates and compares with 0 [ISO 6.5.15/4]. Based on the result of the
comparison, the second or third operand is evaluated and returned [ISO
6.5.15/4], converted to the type that is the fourth argument of the 'cond'
constructor. This explains the reason for this fourth argument: without this
fourth argument, since only one of the second and third operands are evaluated,
we would not have enough information to calculate the type of the result, which
depends on the types of both second and third operands.

A structure member expression requires a structure as left operand [ISO
6.5.2.3/1]. The right operand must be a member of the structure [ISO 6.5.2.3/1].
If the left operand results in an object designator, the result is an object
designator extended with the right operand; if the left operand results in a
value, the result is the value of the member [ISO 6.5.2.3/3].

A structure pointer member expression requires a pointer to a structure as left
operand [ISO 6.5.2.3/2]. Even though [ISO 6.3.2.1/3] allows an array (of
structures) to be used as left operand because it is converted to a pointer, in
our formalization we are more strict and regard that behavior as an error. The
right operand must be a member of the structure [ISO 6.5.2.3/2]. The result is
an object designator, obtained by appending the member to the object designator
carried by the pointer [ISO 6.5.2.3/4].

An array subscripting expression requires a first operand that evaluates to an
object designator of an element i of an array, and a second operand that
evaluates to an integer j [ISO 6.5.2.1/1]. In order for the result to be well
defined, j must be non-negative and i + j must be less than the array's length
[ISO 6.5.6/8]. If well defined, the result is an object designator, obtained by
replacing the index i of the object designator with i+j. Note that if the first
operand is an array, it is converted to a pointer to an array's initial element,
i.e. i is 0 and thus the result is element j of the array, as expected.

As explained earlier, the null pointer constant has type 'void*', and therefore
it returns a null pointer to void. *)

%subsection (* Zero values *)

(* As formalized later, all the objects declared in our C subset are initialized
to 0. For structures and arrays, 0 means that all the members and elements are
recursively initialized to 0 [ISO 6.7.9/10]. To this end, the following op
returns the 0 value of the given type. When the type is a structure, the op
looks up its structure information in the state in order to recursively
calculate 0 values for all the members of the structure. The recursive call on
the members is achieved via the auxiliary op that returns a list of 0 values for
a list of types: the members are ordered according to their names, and a list of
0 values is generated in that order.

It is an error if the type to calculate a 0 value of, is 'void' or a structure
type not present in the state. It is also an error if there is some circularity
in the structures, which could cause the op not to terminate. Recall that the
non-circularity of the structures is part of the state invariants.

Note that zeroOfType itself is not defined in the Monad, but instead represents
errors using the Option type; this is so that TranslationUnits can be evaluated
outside the Monad as well. *)

(* We now formalize the execution of statements.

FIXME HERE: update this documentation!

The left operand of an assignment must denote an object [ISO 6.5.16/2,
6.5.16/3]. The left and right operands must be (i) two arithmetic operands, or
(ii) two compatible structures, or (iii) two pointers to compatible types, or
(iv) a pointer to a non-void type and a pointer to void, or (v) a pointer (left)
and a null pointer constant (right) [ISO 6.5.16.1/1]. Our C subset has no notion
of atomic, qualified, and unqualified types. The case of a left '_Bool' operand
does not apply to our C subset. In case (i), the right operand is converted into
the type of the left operand and stored into it. In case (ii), the right operand
structure is stored into the left operand, unchanged. We consolidate cases
(iii), (iv), and (v), which all involve pointers, by converting the right
operand pointer into the left operand's pointer type -- recall that op
'convertPointer' preserves the type safety of our C subset by disallowing
conversions between non-null pointers of incompatible types. We use op
'convertToPointerIfArray' on the right operand -- see discussion in comments for
op 'checkStatement'.

The condition of an 'if' statement is evaluated first, and a branch is executed
depending on whether the condition is 0 or not.

A 'return' statement removes the top frame of automatic storage, because the
function is exited. As explained above, we undefine all the pointers to objects
that existed in that frame.

When a block is entered, a new scope is added to the automatic storage. This new
scope is retracted when the block is exited. As explained above, when the scope
is retracted, we undefine all the pointers to objects that existed in that
scope.

The execution of a 'while' loop [ISO 6.8.5] yields 'nonterm' if there is a
stream (i.e. infinite sequence) of states that starts with the initial state and
such that for each state i in the stream (i) the controlling expression of the
loop always yields a non-0 value (i.e. the test is true) and (ii) executing the
loop body in the state i yields state i + 1 with the 'next' completion.
Otherwise, we repeatedly execute the loop until either the condition is false or
the body yields a 'return' statement completion: this is achieved by first
testing the condition, then (if true) executing a block consisting of the body
followed by a copy of the 'while' loop itself (if the body yields a 'return'
statement completion, the copy of the 'while' loop is not executed).

The execution of a 'do' loop [ISO 6.8.5] is equivalent to the execution of the
body of the loop followed by a 'while' loop that has the same controlling
expression and the same body as the 'do' loop.

The execution of a 'for' loop [ISO 6.8.5] is equivalent to the execution of the
statement used as first expression (if present), followed by a 'while' loop
whose test is the test of the 'for' and whose body consists of the body of the
'for' followed by the statement used as third expression (if present) [ISO
6.8.5.3/1]. If the test is absent from the 'for' loop, the execution is
equivalent to having the non-0 constant 1 as the test [ISO 6.8.5.3/2].

The argument expressions of a function call are evaluated, and the values passed
as arguments. Arrays are converted to pointers [ISO 6.3.2.1/3]. The arguments
are stored into a new scope in a new frame in automatic storage. The body of the
function must be a block, whose block items are extracted and executed (as
opposed to executing the whole block, which would otherwise create another
scope, which would be incorrect). If the function has a non-void return type but
fails to return a value, or returns a value that is not assignable to its return
type, it is an error. If the returned value is undefined, the behavior is
undefined.  Otherwise, the returned value is converted, as if by assignment,
into the return type [ISO 6.8.6.4/3]. If the function returns 'void', but a
value is returned, it is an error. In the absence of errors, function execution
results in a new state and an optional value (present iff the function has a
non-'void' return type). *)

compilation uses translation environments during the compilation,
