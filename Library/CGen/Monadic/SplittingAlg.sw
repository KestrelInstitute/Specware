  can be "split" in two, zero or more times. The entire entity (with no
  splitting) is represented by the empty list, and if w represents some portion
  of the entity then SplitL :: w and SplitR:: w, respectively, represent the
  "left half" and the "right half" of the result of splitting the w portion. *)

  to be compatible with each other, meaning that, intuitively, a splitting
  multiset could represent some duplication of the portions of a splittable
  entity. For example, a splitting multiset could contain two copies of the
  "left half" of an entity. Splitting multisets that do not contain such
  duplication are "consistent", and are called splitting sets. *)
