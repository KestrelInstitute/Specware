=======

Specs in this directory and subdirectories (if any) are up for
scrutiny and tentative use.

A hopeful eventual fate is that they'll end up in the Libraries
for general use.

  !!THE SPECS IN THIS DIRECTORY MAY CHANGE WITHOUT NOTICE!!

If you actually make use any of this stuff in a project, it is
prudent to make a copy and use that.


Conventions
-----------
Each "unvetted" .sw file should start with a single
block-comment containing at least the following info:

* date
* author
* purpose
* use -- inasmuch as not obvious
* known problems or reservations

Protocol
--------
Whoever sees an improvement or problem can just go in and if
possible improve the spec, and in any case report this, using a
similar format as above, so that the block-comment becomes a
inspection+change log.

For an example see ExampleSpec.sw
