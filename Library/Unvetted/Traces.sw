This is a spec for traces of "things" in time.

The spec could be amenable to generalizations, some of which are indicated by
comments in the spec.

Trace qualifying spec

  (* We model time densely using (non-negative) rational numbers. Alternatives
  are modeling time discretely using integer numbers or continuously using
  real numbers. Eventually, this spec should be parameterized over a suitable
  notion of time, which can be instantiated to be integers, rationals, reals,
  or others (e.g. records consisting of a date and a time). *)

  import Rational

  type Time = NonNegativeRational

  (* Normally, a trace of something (e.g. events) is a (potentially infinite)
  sequence of those things, which can be modeled by a function from Nat to the
  type of those things. Here, since we want to associate time to everything in
  the trace, we use a map from time instants to the type of the things in the
  trace; the linear order of time instants automatically defines the
  sequentialization of the elements of the trace. These traces of things in
  time are captured by type DiscreteTrace below.

  We require a trace to contain a finite number of elements in every time
  interval. Eventually this requirement should be factored out, defining two
  types of discrete traces: one with a finite number of elements in every time
  interval, and one with a potentially infinite number. *)

  def last tr =
    if finite? tr
    then let t = max (domain tr) in Some (t, tr @ t)

  (* Since time is modeled densely with rational numbers, we introduce a
  notion of continuous traces as functions from (all) time instants to some
  type. Perhaps "DenseTrace" could be a better name, while "ContinuousTrace"
  could be used when modeling time continuously with real numbers. *)

  type ContinuousTrace a = Time -> a

  % check whether trace is constant in set of times (usually an interval):

  op constantIn infixl 20 : [a] ContinuousTrace a * Set Time -> Bool
  def constantIn (tr,times) = (ex(x) (fa(t) t in? times => tr t = x))

  % if trace constant in set of times, return that constant value:

  def constantValue tr times =
    if tr constantIn times then
      Some (the(x) (ex(t) t in? times && tr t = x))
    else None  % op totalized via Option

  (* We introduce a notion of traces of things that have extents in time. Each
  thing starts at a time instant and ends at a time instant, i.e. has a closed
  range of times associated to it. A trace is a set of such "segments" of
  things in time. Note that segments may overlap in time. *)

  % traces of non-overlapping segments (segments are sequential and separated):

  % return first segment of trace, if trace is not empty:

                     (fa(seg1) seg1 in? tr && seg1 ~= seg =>
                               (extent seg) allLess (extent seg1)))
    else None  % op totalized via Option

  % return last segment of trace, if trace is finite:

    else None  % op totalized via Option

  (* Given a trace of non-overlapping segments, at any time instant there is
  either no segment or exactly one segment. Thus, we can build a continuous
  trace of the segment at every time instant, using Option for the instants
  with no segment. *)

     NonOverlappingSegmentTrace a -> ContinuousTrace (Option a)
  def toContinuous tr t =
    if ~(ex(seg) seg in? tr && t in? extent seg) then None
    else let seg = the(seg) seg in? tr && t in? extent seg in Some seg.1

  (* The notion of discrete traces and segment traces could be unified by
  generalizing the elements of discrete traces to have possibly non-zero time
  extents, so that discrete traces would become what now are segment
  traces. We could then define a subtype of discrete traces such that all
  elements have zero extents, i.e. they are instantaneous, obtaining what now
  are discrete traces. *)
