% Status: I changed some things in this file to get it to proc.  Not
% sure if it is correct or needed.  -Eric, 10/11/12

%TODO combine some ops and defs in this file into ops.

op [a] list2set (lst : List a) : Set a = foldl (fn (set, elem) -> set_insert(elem, set)) empty_set lst

% Cons is now a constructor.

% %NOTE: cons doesn't satisfy the axioms for using set_fold.  It seems that it
% doesn't make sense to just convert a set to a list, because the result is not
% unique (we'd like to maybe return a sorted list, but the type of the set
% elements may not support an ordering).
% def [a] set2list: Set a -> List a = set_fold [] Cons

%completely bad implementation of size
%op size : [a] Set a -> Nat 
%def size(s) = length (set2list s)

%TODO do we still need this?
(*
  why do you need it to be 1-1?
  op [a,b] set_map : ((a -> b) | 1-1?) -> Set a -> Set b
  op [a,b] 1-1? : (a -> b) -> Bool

  axiom set_map is
        (fa(f,x,s) x in? s => (ex(y) (y in? set_map(f,s) && y = f(x)))) &&
        (fa(f,y,s) y in? set_map(f,s) => (ex(x) (x in? s && y = f(x))))
*)

% This was a conflict.  -Eric
% %Another awful hack
% op [a,b] Set.map : (a->b) -> Set a -> Set b
% def [a,b] Set.map f s =
%     list2set (map f (set2list s))

%TODO make this a definition or prove it from the def just below.
%could also define as filtering the set and seeing if the result is equal to the original set
%TTODO The axiom seems contradictory.  I can use it to prove false (just call sledgehammer).
%TTODO We now have a forall? operator in Set.
op [a] Set.forallIn : Set a -> (a -> Bool) -> Bool
%   axiom Set.forAllIn is fa(x,s,p) Set.forallIn s p <=> (x in? s => p(x))
  
def Set.forallIn s p =
    set_fold true (&&) (Set.map p s)

op flatten : [a] Set (Set a) -> Set a
%TODO interesting that there are no formals given here.  Maybe this is a use case for using def insted of op?  Or can we do the same with op?
def flatten = set_fold empty_set (Set.\/)

%% op SoL.flatten : [a] Set (List a) -> List a

%% %Convert a finite map to a function.

%% %We could instead have this return a function from a to Option b.
%% op fm2fn : [a,b] Map(a,b) -> (a -> b)

%% op numRange : Nat * Nat -> List Nat
