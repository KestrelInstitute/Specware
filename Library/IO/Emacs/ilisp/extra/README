ILISP Extra
===========

ILISP is a powerful GNU Emacs interface to many dialects of Lisp.

This is the 'contrib' directory: software that is useful in
conjunction with ILISP.

HyperSpec
---------
Note that some software in this directory (HyperSpec packages in
particular) is 'non free', according to the definition accepted by the FSF
(see <http://www.gnu.org> for the definition).  However, the HyperSpec (as
appearing on Xanalys site--formerly Harlequin Ltd.) and these interfaces to
that reference are very valuable to Common Lisp programmers and therefore
they are provided with ILISP, although in a separate directory.
