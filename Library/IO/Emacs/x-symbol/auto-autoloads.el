*Parse buffer to find image insertion commands.
Parse buffer to display glyphs at the end of image insertion commands.
Image files are converted to \"image cache files\" with images not
bigger than `x-symbol-image-max-width' and `x-symbol-image-max-height'
having a image format XEmacs understands.  The conversion is done by a
program determined by `x-symbol-image-converter', currently you need
\"convert\" from ImageMagick.  To make this conversion fast, we use
asynchronous processes and two cache hierarchies:

 * Memory cache (`x-symbol-image-memory-cache'): buffer-local alist
   FILE.eps -> GLYPH, see also `x-symbol-image-use-remote'.
 * File cache: the image cache file, mentioned above, are kept, see also
   `x-symbol-image-update-cache', which is shadowed by a non-nil
   UPDATE-CACHE and `x-symbol-image-cache-directories'.

When the mouse is over an image insertion command, it is highlighted.
button2 starts an image editor, see `x-symbol-image-editor-alist'.
button3 pops up a menu, see `x-symbol-image-menu'.

The image insertion commands are recognized by keywords in the language
access `x-symbol-LANG-image-keywords' whose value have the form
  (IMAGE-REGEXP KEYWORD ...)
IMAGE-REGEXP should match all images files and is used to initialize the
buffer local memory cache, see `x-symbol-image-init-memory-cache'.

Each KEYWORD looks like (REGEXP [FUNCTION] ARG...).  Image insertion
commands matched by REGEXP are highlighted.  FUNCTION, which defaults to
`x-symbol-image-default-file-name', is called with ARGs to get the file
name of the corresponding image file.  If FUNCTION returns nil, the
command is not highlighted.

Relative image file names are expanded in the directory returned by the
function in the language access `x-symbol-LANG-master-directory', value
nil means function `default-directory'.  Implicitly relative image file
names are searched in a search path, see `x-symbol-image-use-remote'." t nil)

(autoload 'x-symbol-unalias "x-symbol" "\
Resolve all character aliases in active region or buffer.
A char alias is a character which is also a character in a font with
another registry, e.g., `adiaeresis' is defined in all supported latin
fonts.  XEmacs distinguish between these four characters.  In package
x-symbol, one of them, with `x-symbol-default-coding' if possible, is
supported by the input methods, the other ones are char aliases to the
supported one.  The character and all the aliases are represented by the
same charsym.  The info in the minibuffer displays char aliases, you can
resolve a single character before point with \\[x-symbol-modify-key].

8bit characters in files with a file coding `x-symbol-coding' other than
`x-symbol-default-coding' are converted to the \"normal\" form.  E.g.,
if you have a latin-1 font by default, the `adiaeresis' in a latin-2
encoded file is a latin-1 `adiaeresis' in the buffer.  When saving the
buffer, its is again the right 8bit character in the latin-2 encoded
file.  Seven positions in latin-3 fonts are not used, the corresponding
8bit bytes in latin-3 encoded files are not changed.

In normal cases, buffers do not have char aliases: with Mule support,
this is only possible if you copy characters from buffers with
characters considered as char aliases by package x-symbol, e.g., from
the Mule file \"european.el\".  Without Mule support, this is only
possible if you use commands like `\\[universal-argument] 2 3 4'.

The reason why package x-symbol does not support all versions of
`adiaeresis'es:
 * It is confusing to the user to choose among four similar characters.
 * These four versions are not distinguished in Unicode.
 * There are not different tokens for them, neither in the token
   language \"TeX macro\", nor \"SGML entity\"." t nil)

Initialize all input methods for all charsyms defined so far.
Run `x-symbol-after-init-input-hook' afterwards.  This function should
be called if new charsyms have been added, but not too often since it
takes some time to complete.  Input methods TOKEN and READ-TOKEN are
defined with `x-symbol-init-language'.

As explained in the docstring of `x-symbol-init-cset', charsyms are
defined with \"character descriptions\" which consist of different
\"aspects\" and \"contexts\", which can also be inherited from a
\"parent\" character.  All characters which are connected with parents,
form a \"component\".  Aspects and contexts are used to determine the
Modify-to and Rotate-to chain for characters, the contexts for input
method CONTEXT and ELECTRIC, the key bindings, and the position in the
MENU and the GRID.

If a table entry of a charsym does not define its own contexts, they are
the same as the contexts of the charsym in an earlier position in the
\"modify chain\" (see below), or the contexts of the first charsym with
defined contexts in the modify chain.  The modify context of a charsym
is the first context.

Characters in the same component whose aspects only differ by their
\"direction\" (east,...), a key in `x-symbol-rotate-aspects-alist', are
circularly connected by \"rotate-to\".  The sequence in the \"rotate
chain\" is determined by rotate scores depending on the values in the
rotate aspects.  Charsyms with the same \"rotate-aspects\" are not
connected (charsyms with the smallest modify scores are preferred).

Characters in the same components whose aspects only differ by their
\"size\" (big,...), \"shape\" (round, square,...) and/or \"shift\" (up,
down,...), keys in `x-symbol-modify-aspects-alist', are circularly
connected by \"modify-to\", if all their modify contexts are used
exclusively, i.e., no other modify chain uses any of them.  The sequence
in the \"modify chain\" is determined by modify scores depending on the
values in the modify aspects and the charsym score.

Otherwise, the \"modify chain\" is divided into modify subchains, which
are those charsyms sharing the same modify context.  All modify
subchains using the same modify context, build a \"horizontal chain\"
whose charsyms are circularly connected by \"modify-to\".

We build a \"key chain\" for all contexts (not just modify contexts),
consisting of all charsyms (sorted according to modify scores) having
the context.  Input method CONTEXT modifies the context to the first
charsym in the \"key chain\".

If there is only one charsym in the key chain, `x-symbol-compose-key'
plus the context inserts the charsym.  Otherwise, we use a digit (1..9,
0) as a suffix for each charsym in the key chain.
`x-symbol-compose-key' plus the context plus the optional suffix inserts
the charsym." nil nil)
