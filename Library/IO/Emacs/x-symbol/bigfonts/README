Large x-symbol fonts for Isabelle running with ProofGeneral 3.5
  Revision 2, 2004-07-26

This package provides 18 and 24pt x-symbol fonts for presentations.
The fonts were edited manually and some of the characters don't look
particularly nice.  Also, font size is determined at start-up, not
interactively through xemacs' font size menu.  The package was not
tested with GNU emacs.

Apart from this README file, the package contains big18.el and
big24.el, required to set up xemacs.  Move these to a convenient
location (for example, one in your search path).  The file fonts.tar
must be unpacked into the x-symbol package that came along with
ProofGeneral:

  tar xfv fonts.tar -C <your path>/ProofGeneral-3.5/x-symbol/etc

Then do "make" in <your path>/ProofGeneral-3.5/x-symbol/etc/fonts.
This requires a program called "bdftopcf" that usually comes with X11
which you should have installed anyway.

You can now use the large fonts by starting Isabelle with the commands
  Isabelle -p "xemacs -l big18.el"
and
  Isabelle -p "xemacs -l big24.el"

The outcome of the size of the courier font appears to be system
dependent.  This can be adjusted by editing big18/24.el accordingly.

Enjoy.
