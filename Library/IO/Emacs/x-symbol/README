You have downloaded the source distribution of the beta version of package
X-Symbol.  It is intended to be used by developers.  Most users are better
off with the binary distribution x-symbol-VERSION-pkg.tar.gz.

## Emacs: ====================================================================

The installation of X-Symbol on Emacs can be improved.

The file Makefile.emacs is used to compile the binary package (elc files for
XEmacs) for Emacs.  For details, see

   http://x-symbol.sourceforge.net/news.html

If you do not want to use the binary distribution and follow the installation
instructions on the web page, you might want to try "lisp/Makefile".  For the
info file, check "man/Makefile".

Any help in improving the installation of X-Symbol on Emacs is highly
appreciated!  Err, that means, I very much prefer patches to suggestions in
this area...

The best mid- to long-term contribution would be to help the Emacs team with
the implementation of a package system.  It has already considered as useful,
the authors of XEmacs' package system have signed papers, there are just people
missing doing the work...

## XEmacs: ===================================================================

Check & use the Makefile in this directory.

If you want to produce & compile all lisp files, produce the info files and
produce & compile & install the font files, invoke

     make -k all
