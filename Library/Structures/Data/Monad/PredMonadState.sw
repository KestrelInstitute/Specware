(* This file defines predicate monads for reasoning about stateful monadic
computations. To make Monad represent stateful computations, Monad must be a
state monad, and to reason about these stateful computations, we add
state-related combinators to MPred, to recognize uses of state-related
combinators in Monad. Thus, technically, MPred is a state monad as well. *)
