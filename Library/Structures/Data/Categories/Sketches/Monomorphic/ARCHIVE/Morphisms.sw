This is not used at present.

This defines a type for morphisms between sketches. There are many choices
for such morphisms. One would be that a sketch morphism is simply a
morphism on the underlying graph that preserves the equations (if any). A more
general notion would be a morphism maps edges in the source to paths in the
target such that equations are preserved.

The type defined below is not complete. It should be subtypeed so
to ensure that the domain and image of the maps agrees with the
dom and cod fields.

Note that we import two copies of endo-maps.  This is a situation where
having different types for the sets of vertices and the sets of edges
makes things more complicated than we might like.

The spec VertexMaps defines a type VertexMap.Elem and endo maps on that set.
Similarly, EdgeMaps defines a type EdgeMap.Elem and endo maps on it.

The names of the types VertexMap.Elem and EdgeMap.Elem correspond to the
types for the elements of the edge and vertex sets respectively. These
are defined in Graphs.

There might be a better way to ensure the endo maps and sets are defined 
over the same elements rather that by renaming them to coincide.

We import two copies of endo-maps, one for vertices and one for edges.

\begin{spec}
let VertexMaps =
  VertexMap qualifying /Library/Structures/Data/Maps/Monomorphic/Endo in
let EdgeMaps =
  EdgeMap qualifying /Library/Structures/Data/Maps/Monomorphic/Endo in
spec
  import ../Monomorphic
  import VertexMaps
  import EdgeMaps
\end{spec}

Now refine the types for the domain and codomain of monomorphic maps.

\begin{spec}
  type Morphism 

  op compose : Morphism -> Morphism -> Morphism
  op dom : Sketch -> Morphism
  op cod : Sketch -> Morphism
  op vertexMap : Sketch -> VertexMap.Map,
  op edgeMap : Sketch -> EdgeMap.Map
\end{spec}

Should compose be partial? Yes but this makes everything ugly downstream.

The type defines domain and codomain operations. These may be redundant as
the information is carried in type Cat. Think about it.

Must the types for the vertices and edges in the domain and codomain be
the same? They aren't in the case of functors.

\begin{spec}
  op ppSketchMorphism : Morphism -> Pretty
  def ppSketchMorphism sm =
    ppConcat [
      ppString "Vertex map=",
      ppNewline,
      ppString "  ",
      ppIndent (VertexMap.ppMap (vertexMap sm)),
      ppNewline,
      ppString "Edge map=",
      ppNewline,
      ppString "  ",
      ppIndent (EdgeMap.ppMap (edgeMap sm))
    ]
end
\end{spec}
