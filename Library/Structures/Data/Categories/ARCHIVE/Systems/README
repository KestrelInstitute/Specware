Systems are closely related to functors over a free domain. Does it make
sense fo use to have such systems where the functor is not freely generated.

See the README file under Categories/Functors/FreeDomain for
a discussion of how the maps in the these structures should be changed
from Poly to maps that are Mono in their domain.
