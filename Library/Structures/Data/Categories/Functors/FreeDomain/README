The implementation of functors should be changed.

Right now Sketches imports two copies of Mono Sets. One for the set
of vertices and the other for the set of edges.

Functors imports Sketch. It then imports polymorphic maps
and uses two such maps to label the vertices and edges of the
sketch. It would be better define a spec for maps where, at least,
the domain of the maps were monomorphic and then import two copies of
those maps .. one for labelling edges and the other for labelling vertices.

Hopefully this will come later.
