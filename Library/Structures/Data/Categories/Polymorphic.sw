\section{Polymorphic Categories}

The spec below defines a sort for representing categories.  See also the
spec WithMaps for a different, and in some ways better, representation.

The sort is polymorphic in the sense that the same sort can be used at
runtime to represent different categories. For instance, categories of
finite sets, Specs, graphs etc.

In most cases, the polymorphism appearing here is not needed and one
is better to use a monomorphic sort. Also, often, one does not need a
sort for category at all but rather just a spec.  Note that the spec
below is roughly what you get from a naive internalization of the spec
Structures/Math/Categories/Cat. There is another such internalization
without the polymorphism.

This sort of internalization yields definitions closest to Burstall
and Rydeheard's presentation and what David Espinosa did.

Unlike the CatsWithMaps, we do not internalize the sets of objects
and arrows.

This still needs some thought. How do we say that ident only applies to
what is in the set `objects'. Do we need dependent types? I don't think it is
going to help. Perhaps we need an axiom to say that for a category C,
O is a member? of (objects C) iff O member? (domain (ident C)).

Some other issues. Should we distinguish total and partial maps? Should
the domain and codomain of a map be part of the map? Perhaps if the maps 
are total.

Should compose be partial? yes but it messes up any operations that use
compose since they must inspect the result that comes back to
see if is is valid. The other option is to define a subsort of A * A
of those maps that are composable and then define compose over that subset
... but then compose isn't curried any more. And I don't think it is realistic
to check for conformance at compile time. And it doesn't work anyway since it
would require a dependent type.

The other option is to make everything monadic .. then there can be
a monad for partial maps and all the ugly stuff gets hidden.

Should compose take the two arrows as a product or should it be curried? I
prefer curried.

The following defines both only an abstract sort for categories.
A concrete product sort is defined in Polymorphic/AsRecord.spec. The
separation is needed to enable the sort Cat to be refined. In particular,
the sort for cocomplete category comes with the same operators plus one
for computing colimits.

This way we can define operations on categories also applicable to
cocomplete categories.

But this doesn't work .. operations like slice can be defined only
abstractly. We are still obliged to define the slice for both
categories and cocomplete categories. In this case the extra
level of abstraction helps none.

\begin{spec}
Cat qualifying spec {
  import /Library/PrettyPrinter/WadlerLindig

  sort Cat (O,A)

  op ident : fa (O,A) Cat (O,A) -> O -> A
  op dom : fa (O,A) Cat (O,A) -> A -> O
  op cod : fa (O,A) Cat (O,A) -> A -> O
  % op composable? : fa (O,A) Cat (O,A) -> A -> A -> Boolean
  op compose : fa (O,A) Cat (O,A) -> A -> A -> A

  op ppObj : fa (O,A) Cat (O,A) -> O -> Pretty
  op ppArr : fa (O,A) Cat (O,A) -> A -> Pretty
}
\end{spec}

We have omitted the operator composable?. It seems of little use,
even with subsorting, without dependent types.

Should we have pretty printing operations here?
