Polymorphic diagrams mean that the target category is polymorphic in
its objects and arrows. Note that the shapes are monomorphic. This means
that the sets that make up the vertices and edges are monomorphic. This
avoids an excessive number of type variables in the sort definition.
For instance, we prefer the sort Cat to be parameterized solely on sorts
for its objects and arrows. If the category is cocomplete then it must
have an operation for colimit. This must take a diagram to a cocone.
The diagram includes a graph. If the sets that make up the graphs are
polymorphic, then the graphs are polymorphic, and then the diagrams
are polymorphic and then the sort for cocomplete categories must
also be polymorphic on the sorts that make up the shape. So now, Cat
becomes parameterized on the sorts for the objects and arrows but
also the sorts for the vertices and edges. Functors and natural transformations
must also have extra type parameters.
