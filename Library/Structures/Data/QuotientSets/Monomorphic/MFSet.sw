\section{Merge/Find Sets -- Functional}

For a description of the MFSet ADT (merge/find sets), see
Data Structures and Algorithms, by Aho, Hopcroft, and Ullman,
1983, pages 184-189.

The version implemented here is a (slightly? slower) functional variant.

Note: This version also uses value (of type Element) itself as the key
in MFSetMap, implemented as a PolyMap; as opposed to using keys such
as integers in a more efficient map.  It's quite plausible that using
Int for the key and Int * Element for the value would be faster.

This algorithm initializes the parent link for each node to None, and
its rank to 0, and then revises the parent links in such a manner that
all the nodes in the same equivalence class will have the same root
ancestor, except for that root node itself, whose parent will be None.

When merging elements from two classes, it makes the root of the
smaller class a child of the root of the larger class, and compresses
paths to roots in the process.

In fact, the performance of this merge union should be 
O(N * inverse_ackerman(N) * access(N)), where:

\begin{itemize}
\item {N                  } is the number of elements in Map 
\item {inverse_ackerman(N)} is essentially 3 for all practical purposes (i.e, maps up to size 7,625,597,484,987)
\item {access(N)          } is the performance of eval/update for the map implementation of MFSetMap,
                            which is typically O(Log N) for functional versions (e.g. splay or red/black 
                            trees) and O(1) for destructive versions (e.g. hashtables).
\end{itemize}

Hence if MFSetMap is implemented as a typical tree-structured
functional map (e.g splay tree, red/black tree, etc.) with access time
of O(log N), the practical performance of this quotienting algorithm
should be O(N log N).

If MFSetMap were implemented as a map with constant access time
(e.g. a vector or even a hashtable), the practical performance of this
quotienting algorithm should be O(N).  See StatefulMFSet.sw for a less
preferred implementation that uses such destructive updates to avoid
the logarithmic time penalties associated with functional maps and the
constant time penalties associated with cloning nodes for functional
updates.
