\section{Abstract Pretty Printer}

We want to postpone committing to one pretty printer or the other. The
Wadler/Lindig pretty printer has the advantage of being much simpler
and better documented.  The Bjorner/Espinosa printer is complex, has a
poor interface and there is no documentation. It has the advantage that
the coverage of MetaSlang is better. Also, it is probably less likely
to get a stack overflow.

There might be a problem finding a refinement from the following to
the Bjorner/Espinosa printer as many of its operators require indent
information. The Bjorner/Espinosa printer also has more control over
layout.

Also a pretty printer can benefit from state (recording context and
layout information). There might be a win in placing the pretty printer
in the state monad.

### This needs fixing. The qualifier should be generic and
not WadlerLindig.

\begin{spec}
