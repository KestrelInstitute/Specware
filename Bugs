If we have
  sort List.List a
in the primitive types, then the typechecker complains.

Right now String.sw imports List. Perhaps it shouldn't.


There are many places in Nat and Integer where we must qualify
things where we shouldn't have to

In List.length we have to qualify + with "Nat." but the type of 
length should remove any ambiguity
