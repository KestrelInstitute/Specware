From grammar0 to grammar1
-------------------------

* Expand one-ofs

* Some nonces that only have terminal alternatives are expanded in place
  (this is a matter of taste)

* lower-case keywords get a ' (for clarity)

* Put length in front in ArraySelection; put 'element in
  front of the other alternative

* Put 'display in front of the first alternative of ArrayConstruction

* Discriminate the two 'const forms

* Discriminate the three Response forms

* Significant non-word terminals are worded: 'plus, 'minus, ...

* punctuation removed [!"#$%&()*+,-.\/;<=>@\\^_`|~]
  as well as non-discriminating keywords

* eliminate '_' from keywords

* Introduce nonces for the constituents of the alternatives
  for ArraySelector and IfExpression


From grammar1 to grammar2
-------------------------

* Do away with Closed-, Tight-

* IntegerLiteral: Nat

* Replace
  --  N?  by  [ N ]
  --  { N } by !Seq{ N }
  --  N !Seq{ N } by !ProperSeq{ N }
  --  [ !ProperSeq{ N } ] by !Seq{ N }
  --  [ N ] by !Option{ N }

* Check that {...} not nested or body not singleton,
  then eliminate  {  and  }

* Eliminate (expand in situ) Proper... notions;
  replace !Option !ProperSeq by
!Seq
