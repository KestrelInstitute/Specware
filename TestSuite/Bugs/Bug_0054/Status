[7c] CL-USER(53): :sw A#iamabogusspec
;;;      3 resulting toplevel forms
;;; Processing spec iamabogusspec in /usr/home/kestrel/weilyn/specware/Tests/A.sw
[7c] CL-USER(54):

--diagnosis--

Given a uri referring to file foo.sw (e.g. foo or foo#Bogus), if the 
file contained a single term (as opposed to a sequence of decls), the
uri would be assigned to the resulting spec, even if the uri was of
the form foo#Bogus

--solution--

loadFile in Evaluate/URI.sw now ignores lone terms from a file if the uri has a suffix.
