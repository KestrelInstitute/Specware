--description--

Should it be ok to issue the command ':sw ABC' and have all the specs in
ABC.sw be processed (as opposed to calling ':sw ABC#A', ':sw ABC#B' and 
':sw ABC#C', etc.)?

Right now, Specware's giving mixed messages because ':sw ABC' does seem
to process all 3 specs fine, but then gives an error as well.

[7c] CL-USER(57): :sw ABC
;;; Processing spec A in /usr/home/kestrel/weilyn/specware/Tests/ABC.sw
;;; Processing spec B in /usr/home/kestrel/weilyn/specware/Tests/ABC.sw

Unknown unit error: ABC referenced from

Added a new exception FileNotFound ... 
and then a handler used only at the top-level
