--description--

In the spec E, I defined an op f: a -> b.  However, the sorts a and b 
are ambiguous in this spec.  I should have gotten some kind of error 
message, but I did not.

--commentary--

The following spec is erroneously processed without complaints: 

spec 
 op f : Boolean 
 def f = true 
 op f : String 
endspec
