--description--

--solution--

"Print xxx" will evaulate the term xxx, then print the result before returning it.

If xxx refers to UnitId's, the name of each UnitId is printed
(as opposed to its contents).

printSpec prints the import decls plus the local sorts/ops plus the properties

printColimit prints the spec at the apex, but first subtracts the base
spec and then without regard to whether sorts/ops are local or not.

We might want to rethink this command, perhaps giving it some parameters.

--commentary--

(Diagrams print close to original syntax now.)

I re-opened this since there wasn't an explanation of why it was closed.
Current behavior of show is to print the apex spec, and I don't know of a
command that will display the original syntax for a diagram/colimit, etc.
