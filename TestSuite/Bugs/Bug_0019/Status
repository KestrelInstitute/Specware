--commentary--

The addition of a string like "with" to :ad-hoc-keywords and :ad-hoc-symbols 
in tokenizer.lisp fails to do the trick of making the keyword a valid name 
when parsing. 

In particular, I had to remove "with" from the tokenizer and add "with" to 
the :NAME production in rules.lisp to allow "with" to be parsed as an op. 

So at present, the user does not experience the bug .. but the solution 
should be made more uniform.

Affects Languages/SpecCalculus/Parser/Handwritten/Lisp/{rules.lisp,tokenizer.lisp}.
