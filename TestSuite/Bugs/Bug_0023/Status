--description--

If multiple specs are combined (e.g. via imports or colimit) and 
they refer to sorts or ops with overlapping sets of names (e.g. 
{A,B,C} and {A}), the resulting spec may erroneously duplicate 
the problematic sort/op, e.g.: 
  sort {A,B,C} 
  sort {C,B,A} 
This may cause confusion among alternative references to the problematic 
sort/op, e.g. it might cause complaints that the following are duplicate 
declarations: 
  op f : A 
  op f : C 
I don't have a small test case yet, but processing all of flaws will 
trigger it in the final colimit.
