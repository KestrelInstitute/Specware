--description--

	When I attempted to generate lisp for my  
compiled spec, I got the following: 
;;; Processing spec players in  
    C:/Program Files/Specware4.0/Examples/pearlgame/players.sw 
;;; Processing spec twoPlayers in  
    C:/Program Files/Specware4.0/Examples/pearlgame/players.sw 
;;; Processing spec twoPlayersImpl in  
    C:/Program Files/Specware4.0/Examples/pearlgame/players.sw 
CL-USER(5): :swl players#twoPlayers  <<<<<<<<********************* 
Error: Stack overflow (signal 1000) 
  [condition type: SYNCHRONOUS-OPERATING-SYSTEM-SIGNAL] 
Restart actions (select using :continue): 
 0: continue computation 
 1: Abort entirely from this process. 
[1c] CL-USER(6):  
I have attached the spec file below. 
Thanks, Tim
