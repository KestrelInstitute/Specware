--description--

There's a strange problem with code generation / libraries that fails to include all the defun's 
that are needed in <generated-app>.lisp 
E.g., it fails to load String-Spec::LT which is used by some other String-Spec function. 
I thought the problem was just some kind of failure to keep looking once a base function 
was seen, but there are other gaps that don't fit that pattern.  

You can look at ~mcdonald/JFlaws/Generated/JFlaws.lisp 
to see the problem.   Try compiling it without libraries, etc. and you'll see 
warnings about the missing library functions.

--commentary--

For now, I'm including a copy of the base library handcoded lisp with JFlaws, to finesse 
the problem, but we should make a 4.0.3 release to fix this for others.
