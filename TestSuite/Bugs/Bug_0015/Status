Substitute and Translate fail to update the localSorts and localOps, 
so later commands such as Print can be confused into thinking there 
are no local sorts or ops in the result. 

%% One should see the following in the display of BB: 
%%  import <something that refers to B> 
%%  sort Interval = {start: Nat, stop: Nat} 
%%  op isEmptyInterval? : Interval -> Boolean 
%%  def isEmptyInterval? {start = x, stop = y} = (x = y) 
%% and one should NOT see reset or tick, as they are in B

--commentary--


There were many problems with substitute. 
E.g. it was importing the dom of the morphism, not the codomain. 
Also, the spec printer was very confused about local sorts and ops.
	
For now, this may print the import as "import cod(M)" which won't parse. 
That's a problem we can resolve separately, either to find B and print 
"import B" or to make "cod M" legal syntax. [Hmm--it could just import  
M and let coerceToSpec do its thing.]
