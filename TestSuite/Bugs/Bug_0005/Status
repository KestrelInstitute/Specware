--description--

There is a problem with UnitId when they resolve to a path containing links.
So when I did David's install,

  :sw /Library/Base

resolved to paths relative to

  /usr/home/kestrel/cyrluk ...

whereas

  :sw Library/Base

resolved to paths relative to

  /fs/1/home/kestrel/cyrluk

(ie with links removed)

The hope was that the lisp primitive (truename path) would solve it.
But it doesn't resolve the link. The other option was to start a
shell and do a pwd .. but bash gives back the path with the link whereas
tcsh gives back a path without the link. Needs thought.

Happily the following demonstrates that current-directory seems to work:

CL-USER(1): (current-directory)
#p"/fs/1/home/kestrel/cyrluk/"
