--description--

Should it be ok to issue the command ":sw ABC" and have all the specs in ABC.sw 
be processed (as opposed to calling ":sw ABC#A", ":sw ABC#B", ":sw ABC#C", etc.)?  

Right now, Specware's giving mixed messages because ":sw ABC" does seem to 
process all 3 specs fine, but then gives an error as well.

[7c] CL-USER(57): :sw ABC
;;; Processing spec A in /usr/home/kestrel/weilyn/specware/Tests/ABC.sw
;;; Processing spec B in /usr/home/kestrel/weilyn/specware/Tests/ABC.sw
;;; Processing spec C in /usr/home/kestrel/weilyn/specware/Tests/ABC.sw
Unknown unit error: ABC referenced from
1.0-1.2 in [ABC]

--solution--

Added a new exception FileNotFound ... and then a handler used only at the top-level.

Fixed in
