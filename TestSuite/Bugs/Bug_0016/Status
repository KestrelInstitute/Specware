--description--

An incorrect SWPATH produces no error or warning: 

CL-USER(10552): :swpath "C:/WINNT/Profile/lambert/Desktop" 
C:/WINNT/Profile/lambert/Desktop 
CL-USER(10553): :sw /MyUnit 
Unknown unit /MyUnit 
  referenced from "1.0-1.5" in [/MyUnit] 
It should have been "Profiles".  There is no folder C:\WINNT\Profile.

--commentary--

:swpath calls SpecCalc.checkSpecPathsExistence 
SpecCalc.checkSpecPathsExistence should probably be called 
once at start-up on the value of (getEnv "SWPATH"), although there 
is some question about unmounted files systems.
