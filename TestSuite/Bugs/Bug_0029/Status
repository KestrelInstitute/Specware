--description--

Processing this file does not produce any errors, but probably should because
  1. there are 2 unnamed specs;
  2. there are unnamed specs and named specs in the same file;
  3. spec B imports spec A, which is not explicitly named.

--solution--

parser4::parseFile in parser-interface.lisp was processing just the first form, which could be
a single term or a sequence of decls, and was ignoring any remaining terms/decls.

This also explains why no error was reported for the second and third specs.

Fixed in version 1.4 of parser-interface.lisp
