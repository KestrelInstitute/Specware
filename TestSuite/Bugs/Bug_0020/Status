--description--

When installing Specware, the following error was encountered and the 
installation exited without finishing: 
"1607:Unable to install InstallShield Scripting Runtime" 
Then, whenever an MS Office application was opened, a dialog asking 
for the Office installation CD would appear.
	
--solution--

The setup.exe was configured to try and update the Windows Installer 
version to 2.0 (which comes with XP and Service Pack 3 for other 
Windows versions).  The Office programs were probably installed with 
an earlier (1.2) version of Windows Installer and did not like that 
another application tried to update Windows Installer (Office Service 
Packs also do an update on Windows Installer, as do other poor 
unsuspecting third-party Windows applications).

The setup.exe was configured to not try and update the Windows 
Installer, and an administrator login was used so the the 1607 error 
above did not occur.
