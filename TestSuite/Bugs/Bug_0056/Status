--solution--

Problem was diffuse:

slang-built-in::slang-term-equals-2 didn't recognize hash-tables,
findUnitIdForUnit uses built in equality (aka "=") to compare some values, which may be specs, 
and some of the maps used in specs are from SimpleAsSTHarray, which are implemented in 
hand-coded lisp as hash-tables.

slang-term-equals-2 now does a pair of sub-map tests if the args are hashtables
