CL-USER(37): :sw /BBcol#G 
;;; Processing spec A in /WINNT/Profiles/lambert/Desktop/TrySpecware/BBcol.sw 
Type error: attempting to generate code from an object that is not a specification 
  found at 3.18-3.42 in /WINNT/Profiles/lambert/Desktop/TrySpecware/BB 
Also evidenced by calling :sw on compile.sw in the bitstring library, 
which has a generate lisp call in it. Same error was given. (WLP)
