TODO Could move all other scripts (from Applications/Specware/bin/unix) here.

Guesses at the status of these files:

 Specware_Version - Jim says he uses this, but it seems broken, I asked Jim if we can delete it. -ES
 Make_Distribution_Dir - TODO mentions CVS

main scripts under Scripts/unix/ :

 Generate_Lisp  -- process .sw files to create <application>.lisp (used in JCRE by JCRE/Scripts/unix/JCRE_Client_Generate_Lisp and JCRE/Scripts/unix/JCRE_Simulator_Generate_Lisp, also used in jflaws and autosmart)
 Compile_Lisp   -- compile the <application>.lisp file created above
 Build_Dev      -- load various application files and create lisp image for internal development
 Build_App      -- load various application files and create lisp runtime image (such that user needs no licenses except from Kestrel)

support scripts under Scripts/unix/ :

 Verify_Specware4 - Jim uses
 Verify_Specware - unused for now

 Verify_Lisp    -- call one of following (Jim uses this)
 Verify_SBCL    -- find SBCL images, set up shell vars, etc. (Jim uses this)
 Verify_ACL     -- find ACL     images, set up shell vars, etc. TODO deprecate? (Used by PSL?)
 Verify_CMUCL   -- find CMUCL   images, set up shell vars, etc. TODO deprecate?
 Verify_OpenMCL -- find OpenMCL images, set up shell vars, etc. TODO deprecate?
