The specification starts by importing basic problem theory DRO,
which characterizes problems in terms of 
   D - input type, the given data
   R - output type, the results
   O - satisfaction predicate, which decides when an output z:R is acceptable
       with respect to input instance x:D.

Interpreting these symbols into a problem domain gives us enough
information to specify a problem-solver:

  op f(x:D):{z:R | O(x,z)}

although this function spec is not part of DRO itself.  DRO is so
simple as to seem vacuous, but it allows us to specify abstract
algorithms, such as divide-and-conquer, that solve a given problem
without concern for the details of a concrete problem.

Each divide-and-conquer theory corresponds to a particular signature
for the (co)algebras on its input and output types.  A
divide-and-conquer solver is essentially a homomorphism from the input
type to the output type.

DC_01 is based on the signature implicit in the type functor
    F(T) = 1 + E*T,
for auxilliary type E.

The input type is treated as coinductive (based on destructors);
The output type is treated as inductive (based on constructors).

DC_01 specifies the problem structure that is sufficient to justify a
divide-and-conquer solution to the given problem.  DC_01_scheme then
provides a schematic solver algorithm and specifications for
subalgorithms.  The hard work in applying D&C theory is constructing a
morphism from DC_01 to the problem domain.  In the references, we use
deductive calculation to perform key parts of the construction.  Once
a morphism from DC_01 has been built, the instantiation of the
algorithm scheme in DC_01_scheme is an automatic pushout/substitution
operation.

We construct a morphism (interpret) from DC_01 by either 

(1) selecting a library coalgebra (destructor set) for input type D
and then calculate a algebra (constructor set) for output type R,

or, conversely,

(2) selecting a library algebra (constructor set) for output type R
and then calculate a coalgebra (destructor set) for input type D.
