(* Signature of isomorphism function is:
 op SpecTransform.isomorphism (spc: Spec) (newOptQual : Option String)

BitBool0 uses the most general form with a string argument applied (newOptQual),
a list of pairs of QualifiedIds (iso_qid_prs)
and an empty list of rules (extra_rules)
BitBool is the simples form with a newOptQual supplied, 
a singleton list does not require a brackets,
an empty list can be omitted.
BitBool1 shows how an optional argument can be in brackets and a string does not need 
string quotes if it is an identifier.
