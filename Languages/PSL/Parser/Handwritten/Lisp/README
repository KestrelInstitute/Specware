This is the LISP grammar for the Procedural Specification Language (PSL). This
desparately needs a new name.

The ONLY differences between this file and that for the spec
calculus is that production rules for psl specs are added:
Thus in addition to:

spec {
  ....
}

there is:

psl {
 ....
}

With a psl "spec", there are all the normal things one would find
in a spec plus:
  i) variables (same as ops but with a different keyword)
  ii) procedures.

The tokenizer here is identical to that for Specware4b. Note
that the tokenizer for Specware4b already has single quote as a
"word-symbol-continue-chars".

All references to the package PARSER4 have been changed to PSL-PARSER.
All references to specware4 have been replaced by psl
