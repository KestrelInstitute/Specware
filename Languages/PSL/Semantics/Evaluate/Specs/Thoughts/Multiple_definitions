There is also the question of what to do about multiple definitions.
I have two imports, each with the definition, what should happen?
The point is that the ops have sorts that refer to defined sorts.
So def1 refers to sort srt1 in spec1 and def2 refers to srt2 in spec2.
Should we check eagerly that the definitions are consistent. Or
do we treat things like we do typechecking where we put everything
in and then run through later on to see if there is an
inconsistency and reduce things as much as possible.

If we do it along the way, then addOp needs to take two specs as arguments

importOp targetSpec impSpec opInfo

then we don't need a flag.
