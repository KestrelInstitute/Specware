Suppose you import Finite sets but map Elem.pp -> Id.pp
finite sets also has a pp  but it applies to sets. 
import or translate doesn't detect the conflict.

Suppose you import something that defines an op f.  now you define A.f
inside the spec.  Then you qualify the entire spec with A. You lose
the original f.
