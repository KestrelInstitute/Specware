There is an issue of how to handle imports. The point about imports
is that they have been typechecked. Hence, when they are imported,
they need not be checked again.

One option might be to associate a flag with the opInfo to reflect whether
the op has been typeChecked. This could be a mutable variable. Might be
better to associate the flag with a term.
