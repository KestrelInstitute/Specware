\section{Constraints and Substitutions}

This is experimental. This is used only by the partial evaluator.

Right now, this can't even define how to apply a substitution since that
is specific to the type of spec or term to which it is applied. Needs thought.

But should we apply substitutions to specs and terms or only terms?

Really not clear where this belong? As part of Term?

\begin{spec}
Constraints qualifying spec 
  type Constraints
  op empty : Constraints
endspec
\end{spec}
