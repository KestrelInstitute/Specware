This contains a first attempt at abstracting specs and terms.  It also
contains a layer on top of the abstraction for dealing with "mode specs"
and "transition specs". The former are an extension of a spec structure
used to label the states (modes) in a graph. The second is an extension
used for labelling the transitions (edges) in a graph. Together they
are used for labelling BSpecs.

This has turned into a mess. In particular all the varieties of
monomorphic sets and maps are a disaster. Also the abstract failed
because of the need to pattern match on the concrete structure.

You probably don't want to look closely at the stuff here.

This directory is likely to be moved out of the Specware4 tree.
