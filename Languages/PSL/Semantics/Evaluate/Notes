So there is overloading of application in three ways:
normal function application
procedure application
map evaluation.

what about the idea of changing the op at the apex to have
as its domain a coproduct rather than primed versions. The problem
is that it complicates the morphisms. Right now we have the
attractive property that if name is not mentioned then the
map is assumed to from identity for that element.

What is the right way to handle variables in scope?
