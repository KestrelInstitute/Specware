  %% There are three distinct, but closely related concepts here:
  %%
  %% (1) MSInterpreter.avoidExpanding? is used solely by Interpreter to avoid expanding.
  %% (2) The usual reason for not expanding is a non-constructive definition.
  %% (3) The usual reason something is in SuppressGeneratedDefuns is that it has a non-constructive definition.
  %%
  %% If there are problems using SuppressGeneratedDefuns to determine expansion avoidance,
  %% we may need to introduce a second list of names, specifically for expansion avoidance,

 %%% sjw: The reason for not expanding in the interpreter is that the interpreter has a built-in
 %%% definition, so this belongs in Interpreter.sw and should be more explicit
