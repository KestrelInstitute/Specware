%%% Spec Calculus Abstract Syntax

SpecCalc qualifying spec

 %% We import PosSpec for Position, QualifiedId, ATypeScheme etc.  This is a
 %% bit of a shame as AnnSpec would like to import this spec so as to insert
 %% a spec calculus term in the import of a spec. This would create a cyclic
 %% dependency between specs. At present, this is addressed in AnnSpec by
 %% defining an abstract type SCTerm, which is refined below.

 %% Value.sw indirectly imports Types.sw

 import /Languages/MetaSlang/Specs/StandardSpec    % Position, QualifiedId, Var, etc.
 import /Library/Legacy/Utilities/Lisp             % LispCell (see ProverOptions)
 import /Languages/SpecCalculus/Semantics/ValueSig % ValueInfo
 import UnitId                                     % UnitId, RelativeUnitId
 import SCTerm                                     % SCTerm

 %% All the objects in the abstract syntax are polymorphic and defined at
 %% two levels.  The first level pairs the type the type parameter. 
 %% The second level defines the constructors for the type.
 %% In this way, every type is annotated. The annotation is typically 
 %% information about the position of the term in the file. 
 %% It is not clear that there is any benefit in making this polymorphic. 
 %% Might might be enough to pair it with the Position type and then 
 %% refine that type.  Using two levels ensures that for all objects in the 
 %% abstract syntax tree, the position information is always the second component.

 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

 %% The type Name is used everywhere that one can expect a non-structured identifier. 
 %% This includes for instance, the names of vertices and edges in the shape of a diagram. 
 %% It also includes the qualifiers on op and type names.
 %% 
 %% In the near term, it also includes the identifiers bound by declarations.
 %% These are either let bound or bound by specs listed in a file. Later, we might allow
 %% bound identifiers to be UIDs thus enabling one to override an existing definition.

 type Name = String

 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

 %% The following is the toplevel returned by the parser. 
 %% A file may contain a list of name = term or contain a single term.
