%%% Spec Calculus Abstract Syntax

SpecCalc qualifying spec

 %% We import PosSpec for Position, QualifiedId, ASortScheme etc.  This is a
 %% bit of a shame as AnnSpec would like to import this spec so as to insert
 %% a spec calculus term in the import of a spec. This would create a cyclic
 %% dependency between specs. At present, this is addressed in AnnSpec by
 %% defining an abstract type SpecCalc.Term a, which is refined below.

 %% Value.sw indirectly imports Types.sw
 import ../../MetaSlang/Specs/StandardSpec % for Position
 import /Library/Legacy/Utilities/Lisp     % for LispCell (see ProverOptions)

 %% All the objects in the abstract syntax are polymorphic and defined at
 %% two levels.  The first level pairs the type the type parameter. 
 %% The second level defines the constructors for the sort.
 %% In this way, every sort is annotated. The annotation is typically 
 %% information about the position of the term in the file. 
 %% It is not clear that there is any benefit in making this polymorphic. 
 %% Might might be enough to pair it with the \verb+Position+ type and then 
 %% refine that type.  Using two levels ensures that for all objects in the 
 %% abstract syntax tree, the position information is always the second component.

 type SpecCalc.ValueInfo  % Defined in ../Semantics/Value

 op valueOf    : [a] a * Position -> a
 op positionOf : [a] a * Position -> Position

 def valueOf    (value, _       ) = value
 def positionOf (_,     position) = position

 %% The following is the toplevel returned by the parser. 
 %% A file may contain a list of $\mathit{name} =
 %% \mathit{term}$ or contain a single term. This should not be polymorphic.
 %% The type parameter should be instantiated with the type \verb+Position+.

 %% The support for UnitId's is somewhat simplistic but hopefully sufficient
 %% for now.  A user may specify a unitId that is relative to the current unitId
 %% (ie relative to the object making the reference) or relative to a path
 %% in the \verb+SPECPATH+ environment variable. In the current syntax, the
 %% latter are indicated by an opening "/". In additon, each unitId evaluates
 %% to a full canonical system path. The latter cannot be directly entered
 %% by the user. My apologies for the long constructor names. A relative UnitId
 %% resolves to a canonical UnitId. The latter in turn resolves to an absolute
 %% path in the file system. Recall that file may contain a single anonymous
 %% term or a list of bindings. Thus a canonical UnitId may resolve to two
 %% possible path names. Later we may want to have UIDs with network addresses.

 %% The type \verb+Name+ is used everywhere that one can expect a
 %% non-structured identifier.  This includes for instance, the names of
 %% vertices and edges in the shape of a diagram. It also includes the
 %% qualifiers on op and type names.
 %% 
 %% In the near term, it also includes the identifiers bound by declarations.
 %% These are either \verb+let+ bound or bound by specs listed in a
 %% file. Later, we might allow bound identifiers to be UIDs thus enabling
 %% one to override an existing definition.
