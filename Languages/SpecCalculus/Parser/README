This is the parser for MetaSlang and the SpecCalculus.  The files here
have been adapted from the 3.2 tree.  There is no longer a call to
makeSpec nor calls to "addOp" etc. Instead a raw abstract syntax tree.

This parser will eventually by factored. The spec-calculus will be
separated from the MetaSlang language. The parser for the calculus will
be moved to Applications/Specware/SpecCalculus/Parser/Lisp (or something
like that).

The rationale is that the language for MetaSlang terms and definitions
can be used in the implementation of other languages (eg PSL) and
for other calculi.

Some have suggested that the name of the language should be changed
from MetaSlang to something else. Suggestions? I am not very
keen on Slang.
