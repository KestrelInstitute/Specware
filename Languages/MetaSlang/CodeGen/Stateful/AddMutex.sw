Mutex qualifying spec

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% SpecTransform.addMutexes wraps an invocation of 'with-mutex' around the body 
%%  of selected ops.
%% For now, this is not invoked as part of the generic compilation scripts,
%%  but must be invoked explicitly by ad-hoc code generation scripts.
%%
%% addMutexes should be applied before StatefulUpdates, Globalize, etc.,
%%  since they remove state variables this looks for.
