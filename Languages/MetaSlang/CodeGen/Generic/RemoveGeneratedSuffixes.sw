(*
 * SpecTransform.removeGeneratedSuffixes is a transform that removes suffixes
 * added by removeCurrying, to the extent that this doesn't cause two distinct
 * ops to acquire the same name.
 * 
 * Ops such as foo.bar-3-1-2 are renamed to foo.bar unless some other op 
 * name foo.bar already exists or we would also be renaming some other op
 * such as foo.bar-7-2 to the same name.
 *
 * In the latter case, all the names that would have collided under 
 * simplification are preserved with no change -- none of them are renamed.
