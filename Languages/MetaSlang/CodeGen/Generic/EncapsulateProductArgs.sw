(*
 * getExpandedProductDomain returns the expansion of the domain type of an op 
 * if that expansion is a (non-record) product type.
 *
 * E.g., given:
 *
 *   type A = X * Y * Z
 *   op foo: A -> B
 *
 * it returns:
 *
 *   Some (X * Y * Z)

(*
 * encapsulateProductArgs modifies applications of ops to tuples, for ops that
 * have a single argument with a product type (after type expansion).
 *
 * In such cases, a let variable (_arg) is introduced to bind the product and 
 * this variable is then used as the single argument to the op.
 *
 * E.g., given:
 *
 *   type X = A * B * C
 *   op foo: X -> Y
 *
 * Transform:
 *
 *   foo (a, b, c) 
 *
 * to:
 *
 *   foo (let _arg = (a, b, c) in _arg)
 *
 * Note: This is done for products, but not for records with named fields.
