%% allowing users to replicate this functionality step-by-step.
%%
%% Problems encountered along the way may be indicated via warning messages, 
%% but this transform always returns a spec (possibly the original one).
%%
%% There is no guarantee that the resulting spec will be suitable for code 
%% production, so any SpecToC translator which follows this must anticipate

%% emitCfiles is an identity transform on metaslang specs, with the side-effect 
%% of possibly outputting C files directly from the provided metaslang spec.  
%%
%% The provided metaslang spec might have been produced manually, or by an 
%% invocation of transformSpecTowardsC, or by a series of more detailed 
%% transformations.  
%%
%% emitCFiles should be as simple and direct as possible, and might emit no
%% files if the provided metaslang spec fails to obey appropriate restrictions.
%%
%% The motivation for having this as a distinct transform is that we may wish
%% to first transform the MetaSlang spec, then print it out for examination,
%% then generate C files.
