  % There are some differences between this and what we would get from calling

  % First, when cutting at a CTarget op, sliceSpecInfo would still include its
  % type in the slice.  Unfortunately, the type of a CTarget op is not always
  % representable in C (e.g., for ops such as -_1_sint that are only defined on
  % certain inputs).  Second, sliceSpecInfo doesn't completely exclude extra
  % definitions for ops (introduced via refine def or transformations and
  % manifested in "And" terms), e.g., when calling foldTerm to process *all*
  % subterms of a term.  So I wrote this custom function.  Improvements/changing
  % to sliceSpecInfo might allow us to call that here instead.
