 (*
  * conformOpDecls checks whether we have an opdef of the form
  *
  * type P = A * B
  * op foo: P -> Q
  * def foo (a, b) = ...
  *
  * i.e. the declaration contains the user type name, but the arguments refer to its definition term.
  * ops are transformed to something like
  * 
  * def foo (arg) = 
  *   let a = arg^1 in
  *   let b - arg^2 in
  *   ...
