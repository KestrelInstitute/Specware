(* Term indexing

 Implementation of path indexing, as described in Stickel's report,
 using a discrimination net to compute the getTerms functions.

 Reference: Mark E. Stickel,  The Path-Indexing Method for Indexing
 Terms, Technical Note 473, SRI International, October
 1989

 In OTTER 3.0, McCune writes (file fpa.c):
   \begin{quote}
   FPA indexing is used when searching for unifiable terms, as in inference
   rules and in unit conflict, and it is used when searching for instances,
   as in back subsumption.  (It can also be used when searching for
   more general terms, as in forward subsumption, demodulation,
   and unit-deletion, but discrimination tree indexing is usually better.)
   \end{quote}


To index a term, translate into an appropriate path, then
for each point in the path add the mapping symbol->term to
the corresponding node. This is done by adding symbol to the
end of the path; the set of terms will be at the node reached. 

How to distinguish positions from functions? Don't really have
to, since they are alternated; just give integer values to the
symbols, and it won't matter if some symbols have the same
value as a position. 



 SpecialFlag indicates if there are special function symbols under
 which indexing should not be done. isSpecial identifies these
 function symbols; if there are no special symbols, hopefully
 partial evaluation will optimize this away.
