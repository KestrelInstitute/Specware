\section{A naive category of specifications}

This is to be restructured. We are using a polymorphic category and this
may change later. Similarly we use polymorphic maps.

There is a question about qualifiers. The specs that make up
MetaSlang are all qualified with different names. It is not
clear how they should be qualified if at all.

There should be a separate spec for SpecMorphisms as there
is for Spec. The former should be a refinement of an
abstract sort.

\begin{spec}
spec {
  import /Languages/MetaSlang/Specs/StandardSpec
  import PolyMap qualifying /Library/Structures/Data/Maps/Polymorphic
  import Cat qualifying /Library/Structures/Data/Categories/Cocomplete/Polymorphic

  sort Morphism
  op dom : Morphism -> Spec
  op cod : Morphism -> Spec
  op compose : Morphism -> Morphism -> Morphism
\end{spec}

The following constructs an argument representing the category of specs
and spec morphisms.  This takes an argument to avoid evaluation at load
time and thereby avoids problems to do with the order of evaluation in
the load file.  It would be reasonable to have arguments different from
(). For example, we might provide a choice of pretty printing operations

\begin{spec}
  op specCat : () -> Cat.Cat (Spec, Morphism)

  % axiom dom is fa (m : Morphism) Cat.dom specCat m = dom m
  % axiom cod is fa (m : Morphism) Cat.cod specCat m = cod m
}
\end{spec}
