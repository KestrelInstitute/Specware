 %%% Naming convention:  To avoid confusion when both Foo and Foos exist
 %%%                      (e.g. when type Foos = List Foo), we use
 %%%                      "equalFoo"  or "equivFoo" to compare two Foo's, and
 %%%                      "equalFoos" or "equivFoo" to compare two Foos'es.
 %%%                     This converts less fluently into English, but is 
 %%%                      ultimately less confusing.
