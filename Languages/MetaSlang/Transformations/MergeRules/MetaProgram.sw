%% This spec exports a transformation 'mergeRules' 
%%
%% S0 = S1 { at f { mergeRules [f1,f2]}}
%%
%% that combines a collection of functions (here 'f1', 'f2' identified
%% as parameters to the transformation) into a single function
%% 'f'. The input functions must have the form.
%% 
%%  f1 : (s : StateType |  Pre[s] ) -> (s' : StateType | Post[s,s'])
%%  f2 : (s : StateType |  Pre[s] ) -> (s' : StateType | Post[s,s'])
%%
%% Where 'StateType' can vary between transformation invocations, but
%% must be uniform. The state variables 's' and 's'' can vary between
%% functions 'f1' and 'f2', but will be renamed uniformly in the
%% resulting function 'f'. 'Pre' is a precondition of type 'StateType
%% -> Bool' which 's' can appear free in, and 'Post' is a
%% postcondition of type 'StateType -> StateType -> Bool' in which
%% 's' and 's'' can both appear free.

%% TODO: Describe the rule combination algorithm and correctness
%% criteria as documented in Doug's 'rule-composition.sw' note in the
%% HACMS 'Docs' subdirectory.

%% Issues:
%%
%% - Naming is incredibly brittle. Need to come up with a sane
%%   solution. E.g. if two rules share pre/post condition constraints,
%%   but existentially quantified names are different, then the
%%   algorithm will not work correctly.
%%
%% - We need to normalize pre- and post- state names, instead of
%%   relying on them being the same. This should be easy to implement.
%% 
%% - When generating case-splits, the algorithm doesn't handle
%%   renaming of pattern variables (e.g. if one clause has the
%%   predicate 't = Some x' and a second clause has the predicate 't =
%%   Some y', then we should choose a fresh name 'z' to use as the
%%   pattern variable, and rename x to z in the first clause and y to
%%   z in the second clause.
