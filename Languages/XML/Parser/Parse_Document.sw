  %%  4.3.2 Well-Formed Parsed Entities:
  %%
  %%  The document entity is well-formed if it matches the production labeled 'document'.
  %%
  %%  [Definition: The document entity serves as the root of the entity tree and a starting-point 
  %%   for an XML processor.] 
  %%
  %%  This [W3] specification does not specify how the document entity is to be located by an XML 
  %%  processor; unlike other entities, the document entity has no name and might well appear on 
  %%  a processor input stream without any identification at all.
  %%
  %%  [Definition: XML documents should begin with an XML declaration which specifies the version 
  %%   of XML being used.] 
  %%   
  %%  [Definition: There is exactly one element, called the root, or document element, no part of 
  %%   which appears in the content of any other element.] 
  %%
  %%  For all other elements, if the start-tag is in the content of another element, the end-tag 
  %%  is in the content of the same element. More simply stated, the elements, delimited by start- 
  %%  and end-tags, nest properly within each other.
  %%
  %%  [Definition: As a consequence of this, for each non-root element C in the document, there is
  %%   one other element P in the document such that C is in the content of P, but is not in the 
  %%   content of any other element that is in the content of P. P is referred to as the parent of C, 
  %%   and C as a child of P.]

  %%  [Definition: Markup takes the form of start-tags, end-tags, empty-element tags, entity 
  %%   references, character references, comments, CDATA section delimiters, document type 
  %%   declarations, processing instructions, XML declarations, text declarations, and any white 
  %%   space that is at the top level of the document entity (that is, outside the document 
  %%   element and not inside any other markup).]
  %%
  %%  [Definition: All text that is not markup constitutes the character data of the document.]
