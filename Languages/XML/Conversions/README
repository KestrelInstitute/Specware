The versions prior to the change for ms "?" <=> xml "-p" were:

 GenerateDocument.sw 1.7
 InternalizeDocument.sw 1.14
 InternalizeAux.sw 1.1

To see changes:

cvs diff -r1.7 GenerateDocument.sw
cvs diff -r1.14 InternalizeDocument.sw
cvs diff -r1.1 InternalizeAux.sw

If problems arise, you should be able to revert just these two:

 GenerateDocument.sw 
InternalizeDocument.sw  

The changes to InternalizeAux.sw merely added some new functions
called by InternalizeDocument.sw, so it should not need to be reverted,
as they simply wouldn't be called if InternalizeDocument.sw is reverted.
