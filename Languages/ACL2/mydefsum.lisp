; Defsum: a macro for defining recursive data types 
; by Sol Swords & William Cook

; Please email bug reports to sswords@cs.utexas.edu.
;
; For primary documentation of the content of this book, see the :doc
; topics defsum, defsums, and pattern-match.
;
; This book defines the macros defsum and defsums which can be used to
; define recursive data types analogous to type definitions in
; Haskell. These types are recursive labeled sums of products.
;
; Proofs written using the new type are based on the abstract model of
; constructors, recognizers, and field access.  The underlying list
; representation is (almost) completely hidden: the definitions and
; executable-counterparts of functions operating on the list structure are
; disabled. As a result, proofs using the type only require reasoning about the
; type itself, not its representation. Unlike records, but like Haskell,
; components of a data type cannot be modified once constructed.
;
; A simple example, which defines a simple list structure, is:
;
; (defsum my-list
;    (my-empty)
;    (my-cons car (my-list-p cdr)))
;
; The first item of each list is the *constructor* and the remaining
; items are fields. Constructors with no arguments, like my-empty, 
; represent abstract constants.  For each constructor, a recognizer is 
; also defined, and functions to extract fields from the constructed 
; values. The overall type also has a recognizer. Here
; are all the functions defined by the above:
;
; constructors: my-empty, my-cons
; recognizers: my-list-p, my-empty-p, my-cons-p
; fields: my-cons-car, my-cons-cdr
;
; The sum recognizer my-list-p recognizes only completely well-formed
; structures.  The product recognizers my-empty and my-cons, on the other hand,
; only check the top level "shape" and do not check any types.  (my-cons-p x),
; for example, equals (and (true-listp x) (= (len x) 3) (eq (car x) 'my-cons)).
;
; The example above corresponds to the standard Haskell definition:
;     data MyList a = MyEmpty | MyCons a (MyList a)
; Haskell also allows the fields to be named:
;     data MyList a = MyEmpty | MyCons { car :: a, cdr :: MyList a }
;
; Here is another example:
;
; (defsum person
;   (student (stringp name) (integerp year) major)
;   (professor name degree-year school (symbolp topic))
;   (administrator name title (person-p manager)))
;
; Using this example, we can illustrate the matching form:
;
; (pattern-match x
;               ((student nm yr maj) body1)
;               ((professor a b c d) body2)
;               ((administrator p d q) body3)
;               (& body4))
;
; This is still work in progress. Related work (which could be much more
; appropriate for any given application) includes the following (see the files
; for proper attribution):
;
; the records book, distributed as books/misc/records.lisp; the typed records
; book, distributed as books/workshops/2004/greve/support/defrecord.lisp; and
; the structures book, distributed as books/data-structures/structures.lisp.
;
; To see how this library works in detail, you can examine the events
; introduced by a defsum form such as, in this example, the above "my-list"
; form.  The following will print out the list of events:
; (include-book "defsum")
; (include-book "defsum-thms")
; :trans1 (defsum my-list
;           (my-empty)
;           (my-cons car (my-list-p cdr)))

(defmacro defsum (name &rest defs)
  ":Doc-Section Miscellaneous
 Define a recursive data type similar to a Haskell type definition.~/

 EXAMPLE:
 ~bv[]
 (include-book ``defsum'')
 (set-ignore-ok :warn)
 (defsum my-list
   (my-empty)
   (my-cons car (my-list-p cdr)))
 ~ev[]

 This declaration says that an object is of the type ~c[my-list] if it
is either of the type ~c[my-empty] or ~c[my-cons], where ~c[my-empty]
is an empty structure and ~c[my-cons] is a structure with two fields:
the ~c[car], an arbitrary object; and the ~c[cdr] which is of type
~c[my-list].  In this case, recognizers ~c[my-list-p], ~c[my-empty-p],
and ~c[my-cons-p] are defined along with constructors ~c[my-empty] and
~c[my-cons] and destructors ~c[my-cons-car] and ~c[my-cons-cdr].  The
necessary macros are also defined to enable pattern-matching using the
constructors (~pl[pattern-match]).  For mutually-recursive data types
~pl[defsums].  It may also be informative to look at the translated
version of a defsum form using :trans1.~/

 Note that a defsum form produces several logic-mode events inside an
encapsulate.  Despite the author's best intentions, not every such
automatically-generated event will complete successfully.  If you
encounter a defsum form that fails, please email it to
sswords@cs.utexas.edu (with or without fixing the bug yourself.)

 Several theorems about the new type are defined so as to enable
reasoning based on their abstract model rather than their underlying
list representation. For most reasoning these theorems should be
sufficient without enabling the function definitions or
executable-counterparts.  In case these do need to be enabled,
theories named (for the above example) ~c[my-list-functions] and
~c[my-list-executable-counterparts] are defined.

 In addition to the recognizer, constructor, and destructor functions,
a measure function is also defined which counts the number of nested
objects of the sum type.  In the example above, the measure function
is my-list-measure and the measure of an object is 1 if it is not a
my-cons, and 1 plus the measure of its my-cons-cdr if it is.

 Defsum accepts some keyword arguments.  Be aware that not all
combinations of these arguments have been tested extensively.  Again,
please send bug reports to sswords@cs.utexas.edu if you find a defsum
form that does not succeed.

 ~c[:arithmetic] - By default, each ~c[defsum] event expands to an
encapsulate which locally includes the book arithmetic/top-with-meta.
If an incompatible arithmetic book has already been included, this may
cause the defsum to fail.  But the other arithmetic book may also have
theorems that allow the defsum event to succeed if we don't attempt to
include the arithmetic book.  This can be done by setting
~c[:arithmetic nil].

 ~c[:guard] - may be set to ~c[t], ~c[nil], or ~c[:fast].  By default
it is set to ~c[t], in which case minimal guards are set for all
functions.  If set to ~c[nil], guards will not be verified for any
functions; this is useful in case some field type recognizers don't
have their guards verified.  If set to ~c[:fast], an additional
recognizer for each product is defined named ``foo-p-fast'' if the
product is named foo.  This has a guard such that its argument must be
a valid sum object.  It is then logically equivalent to the other
recognizer, but in execution only checks that the symbol in the car of
the object matches the name of the product.  The pattern matcher for
each product then uses the fast recognizers.  Thus fast guards result
in a small (?) gain in performance in exchange for a (hopefully
trivial) degradation in logical complexity.

~c[:short-accessors] - ~c[t] by default; may be set to ~c[nil].  If
~c[t], each field accessor first checks whether the object is of the
correct product type and returns nil if not.  This allows for an
additional theorem saying that if x is not of the correct product
type, then the accessor returns nil.  If ~c[nil], the nth accessor
returns ~c[(nth n x)] regardless of x's type.  When guards are turned
on, this is implemented with an ~c[mbe] so there should be no
performance difference between the two options.  When guards are off,
performance will be somewhat better if this feature is turned off.

 ~c[:compact] - By default, a defsum constructor makes a product
object by putting its components into a cons tree using n-1 conses,
but a prettier list representation is also supported which uses n
conses to store the elements in a flattened list which is easier to
read when printed.  Set ~c[:compact nil] if you prefer this
representation.

 ~c[:hons] - If HONS mode is in use, the flag ~c[:hons t] causes all
defsum forms to be built with HONSes rather than regular conses.  See
~il[hons-and-memoization].

 It may be necessary to include some function definition in a mutual
recursion with the sum recognizer function.  In this case simply put
the defun form inside the defsum form, i.e.

 ~bv[]
 (defsum lisp-term
   (lisp-atom val)
   (func-app (symbolp function) (lisp-term-listp args))
   (defun lisp-term-listp (args)
     (declare (xargs :guard t))
     (if (atom args)
         (null args)
       (and (lisp-term-p (car args))
            (lisp-term-listp (cdr args))))))
 ~ev[]

 If such a function is included, however, no measure function will be
defined for the sum.

 Usually it is not necessary to specify a measure for such a function;
because there is currently no way of directly specifying the measure
for the sum's recognizer, specifying an exotic measure on such a
function is likely to fail.  If you come up against this limitation,
please send an example to sswords@cs.utexas.edu."

   (sum extfns kwalist constructor-tag-alist) (defsum-munge-input name defs)
   (defsums-fn sum kwalist extfns constructor-tag-alist)))



(defmacro defsums (&rest sums)
  ":Doc-Section Miscellaneous
  Define a set of mutually-recursive data types. ~/

 EXAMPLE:
 ~bv[]
 (defsums
   (my-term
    (my-atom val)
    (my-application (symbolp function) (my-term-list-p args)))
   (my-term-list
    (my-nil)
    (my-cons (my-term-p car) (my-term-list-p cdr))))
 ~ev[]

 ~l[defsum].  This form is used when you want to define two or more types which
may be constructed from each other.  In the above example, ~c[my-term] and
~c[my-term-list] could not be defined using independent defsum forms;
their recognizer functions need to be defined in a mutual recursion. ~/

 Defsums accepts the same keyword arguments as defsum.

 If you want some function to be defined inside the same mutual-recursion in
which the recognizers for each of the sums and products are defined, you may
insert the defun inside the def-mutual-sums form, i.e.

 ~bv[]
 (defsums
  (foo
   (bla (bar-p x))
   (ble (foo-p x) (bar-p y)))
  (bar
   (blu (integerp k))
   (blo (symbolp f) (foo-list-p a)))
  (defun foo-list-p (x)
    (declare (xargs :guard t))
    (if (atom x)
        (null x)
      (and (foo-p (car x))
           (foo-list-p (cdr x))))))
 ~ev[]

 Usually it is not necessary to specify a measure for such a function;
because there is currently no way of directly specifying the measures
on the sums' recognizers, specifying an exotic measure on such a
function is likely to fail.
 
 As with defsum, def-mutual-sums requires the (possibly local) inclusion of the
defsum-thms book."
