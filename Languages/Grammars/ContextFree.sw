%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%% These basic grammar files provide a structure for defining grammars from 
%%% which compatible AST's, parsers, an-d printers can be synthesized.
%%%
%%% The general strategy to produce a useful gramamr is:
%%%
%%% (1) Define a complete initial grammar using primitive tokens such as 
%%%     unicode characters.  This should adhere as rigorously an-d literally 
%%%     as possible to published standards.
%%%
%%% (2) Transform that original grammar to simplify repetitions, explicate
%%%     implicit subrules, etc.
%%%
%%% (3) Extract a finte state machine tokenizer from the low-level rules.
%%%
%%% (4) Extract a revised grammar whose tokens are the outout from the tokenizer.
%%%
%%% The latter steps could be repeated at multiple levels, using more complex 
%%% tokens.

  %% Note:

  %% These two rules may simplify some low-level productions, for example 
  %% those involved in tokenization.
  %%
  %% But they move beyond a simple context free grammar into intersections 
  %% of grammars, so use sparingly.
    
  | Diff     RHS * RHS            % match the first RHS, but not the second 
                                  %  (e.g. all chars except ...)

  | Restrict RHS * (RHS -> Bool)  % match the RHS, but only if predicate is true
